            "content": "My research is centered around exploring the human experience, personal narratives, and digital media. I'm particularly interested in highlighting the stories and perspectives of those whose voices are often marginalized or excluded from the dominant historical narrative. One of the main themes in my research is the idea of storytelling as a means of truth-telling. I'm interested in finding alternative ways to convey personal narratives and challenge traditional historical narratives. This often involves using digital media, interactive installations, and immersive experiences to create a more engaging and participatory approach to storytelling. I work on a bunch of projects that exemplify this research, A Secret History of American River People, Black Rock Station, and my games projects."

            "content": "My research and scholarly creative work focus on unique ways to explore the human experience, often highlighting the personal narratives of those whose stories are frequently excluded from the dominant historical narrative through the use of digital media. My interest emerges from the literary experience in which truth is often intimate, subjective, and deeply personal, leading me to explore other ways of truth-telling, including playable media and the telling of history, the grand narrative used to justify the present. In the people's history tradition, narratives form a collage of experience, sometimes complementary and other times contradictory, a bottom-up exploration of a topic and a deliberate challenge to the modernist top-down historical tradition."

            "content": "There are two deeply intertwined threads of my research. In one thread, research in river communities involves a dialogical practice rooted in the reflexive, mutuality of social history, an emphasis on listening to unheard voices with an awareness of the effects of privilege, class, race, and gender. In another thread, research presenting these stories involves interdisciplinary work spanning spatial art, photography, video, new media, social practice, and performance. Whether sculptural, performative, or through technology, my research is centered on people's personal stories and lived experiences."

I am interested in ways games and technology can be used to frame or facilitate the foregrounding of personal narratives while remaining backgrounded or invisible to the viewer."

My frequent collaborations and regular contact with faculty and researchers at other institutions have resulted in long-term relationships that continue to guide me. Working with students in the academy, my mentorship draws on my three and a half decades of creative coding, twenty-five years of web development and design, and two decades as an artist to encourage them to use web and network technology to meet and expand their artistic goals."
