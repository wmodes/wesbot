Co-related Space highlights participants' active engagement and experimentation with sound and light, including complex direct and indirect behavior and relationships. The key to Co-related Space is a sophisticated visual tracking system combined with complex data aggregation. The system observes people's movements over time, including moving fast or slow, dancing, standing close, hugging, and synchronizing their movements. Visually and sonically, these observed and inferred behaviors are highlighted with sound and light. Visually, the piece sketches laser lines around and between participants with the thickness, quality, and dynamics of the lines determined by the nature of their participation and the relationships between them. In Co-related Space, sound, light, and your fellow participants are everything. Sonically, the piece draws inspiration from ambient sound, developing the complexity and dynamism of each participant's sonic \"voice\" as they interact within the space. The piece was shown at several venues in the Bay Area from 2014 to 2016.####""")
