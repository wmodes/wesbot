"At CSUMB so far it’s been nothing but positive comments. In fact, we have
seen a surge in new members over the last day and half. We got a lot of
negative comments over the strike itself (folks saying it was irresponsible
in a bad budget year, that we had been taken over by radical lefties lol,
etc.), but so far, nothing negative on the TA. At least not at CSUMB.
I know there are folks at other CSU’s who are disappointed or feel we
could have gotten more. We are different in terms of our culture, compared
to campuses like LA and SF…where I think the desire to strike and stay on
strike was much stronger than at CSUMB (even though our people did a great
job and showed up in strong numbers Monday). In places where there has been
vocal opposition to the TA, I think some of it might be communication and
confusion. A lot of folks thought we didn’t get certain wins that we
actually did (like counselor ratios, where management accepted our
bargaining proposal), because their chapter didn’t provide a comprehensive
overview of the TA details.
But some of it is genuine disappointment and frustration with compromise
when we still had 4 days of strike left. Thats real and it’s somethng we
need to talk through as a union, on how the decision was made, and why. In
LA and SF, that is the primary source of anger. Some folks at Long Beach
and DH too. We had lots of meetings leading up to the strike and during the
strike where the debate was centered on when we would be willing to come
back to the table and review an offer from management. LA reps wanted us to
wait one more day before agreeing to a TA, even if the content of the TA
didn’t change. Some wanted us to continue the strike at all cost,
regardless of the numbers on picket lines, and felt like negotiations
happened too soon. So across the state it’s a mix of emotions. Which is to
be expected…it’s a tough thing and it’s complicated. We are seeing a lot of
the anger coming from tenure-line faculty…who resent that we got bigger
raises for lecturers than for the TT folks.
Anyway, thats a long winded answer, haha. But at CSUMB, folks seem
pleased. And if there are grumpies…they haven’t talked to me or our team
about it.
Hope you’re doing well!

Hi Meghan,
Was there any negative feedback from members or was it all positive?","I'm glad that you have gotten nothing but positive comments. I worry that
CSUMB is so under-resourced, neglected, and disregarded by the
administration, that they have long lost the spirit to resist exploitation.
But you know, I'm a radical leftie who doesn't feel anyone who isn't a
radical leftie has any business expressing opinions about labor organizing.
:-)

Yeah, I read online terms like ""stabbed in the back"" and ""decertify the
union"" so I knew everyone everywhere wasn't completely happy about it. I
have long thought that workload protections, reducing the number of units
that represent ""full-time"", and multi-year contracts needed to be on the
table, so a 5% contingent bump doesn't feel like enough for me to ever
remotely consider coming back to the CSU system. But I appreciate your work
and the work on the various teams.

Here's hoping for more radical lefties to join a fighting union!

Life at UCSC is great, honestly. The historic wins that UC-AFT won around
wages, working conditions, workload protections, and multi-year contracts
literally changed my life."

Hey All…we get a lot of feedback to our general CFA-MB account, and I get a lot of emails and texts from folks. Just wanted to share with you all some of what folks are saying at MB: 





""Congrats!!!!!! Gracias!!!”  


""Good news on the strike win!! I’m so grateful to be a part of CFA.” 


""THANK YOU!!!! “  


""Thank you, thank you!  I thought the most important thing to do was to get a raise for lecturers b/c they are so underpaid and you helped make it happen!!”


""Million-dollar Millie totally underestimated us!""


""Wow! Power…. I’ll get up and send out announcements to the students.  I’m deeply grateful to you and all the organizers...Much, much love and gratitude to you
 my friend.”


“I’m sure you still have plenty to do. But it’s a good outcome and the experience was very empowering…”


""Whenever an inclusive rebel alliance scores a win against an evil empire a Yub Nub (big party!) must be held. It is modeled for us in the sacred epics from the

""Looks like profs have a lot more pull than GSA’s. Took the grad students at UC 6 weeks of striking to get the fuckers to listen. Took y’all less than a day. As
 if the admin somehow really didn’t believe you would walk.”

Subject: Enrolling in Art106E
To: Wes Modes <wmodes@gmail.com>


Hello Professor Modes,
I hope you had a great break and are getting back into the swing of things.
I'm not sure if you remember me but I was in your intro to website design
class last quarter. I am very interested in enrolling in Art 106E as one of
my upper divisions. However, I cannot enroll because I am an AGPM major,
not an art major. I would love to learn more about Blender and other 3D
applications so it seems like this class would be a good fit.  Please let
me know if this would be possible, thank you so much!

all the best,

*Natalya Gonzalez (she/her)*

How do I fix this so I can get a clean deploy?
