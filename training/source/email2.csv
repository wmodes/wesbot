,"Casey Reas, as an artist and a designer of the Processing language, speaks
eloquently about this in a few videos I have seen.  You can probably find
them on YouTube.","I'm glad that you have gotten nothing but positive comments. I worry that
CSUMB is so under-resourced, neglected, and disregarded by the
administration, that they have long lost the spirit to resist exploitation.
But you know, I'm a radical leftie who Doesn't feel anyone who isn't a
radical leftie has any business expressing opinions about labor organizing.
:-)

Yeah, I read online terms like ""stabbed in the back"" and ""decertify the
union"" so I knew everyone everywhere wasn't completely happy about it. I
have long thought that workload protections, reducing the number of units
that represent ""full-time"", and multi-year contracts needed to be on the
table, so a 5% contingent bump Doesn't feel like enough for me to ever
remotely consider coming back to the CSU system. But I appreciate your work
and the work on the various teams.

Here's hoping for more radical lefties to join a fighting union!

Life at UCSC is great, honestly. The historic wins that UC-AFT won around
wages, working conditions, workload protections, and multi-year contracts
literally changed my life."
,"So nice of you to say! Lots going on at home. I’m taking family leave next quarter- kid and partner problems it’s been pretty hard. We’re working on the film still and managing. 
Great to hear from you! ","Well, you have my love and support during a tough time. Please take care. 

If you need a very different calm hangout solace, our house is always open to hang out. It's our specialty: we always promise our guests we will be terrible hosts, and arrange no walks and no dinners, nothing you are obligated to do. We'll just let you sit on the couch and read a book quietly if that's what you want."
,"I haven’t been part of the hiring process so I’m not the best person to ask. We always look for research profile ( exhibitions, awards etc) and then there is the deans diversity initiative. You obviously have the skills. I might ask Elliot fir more details he’s more involved than me. Why not apply? 

Hope you are well?","Well, I would never pass up the opportunity to join such a great department that seems to be getting even better with the new faculty additions. So I will definitely apply. Just looking for insider information I guess.

I support the Deans diversity initiative, so if I'm passed up for somebody who brings more diverse voices to the department, I'll be happy for our students and still grateful for the opportunity. 

Joe surprised me by writing back within a day, but with little helpful info. Oh well. 

How are you doing? How's your family? How's the new project?"
,"This all sounds exciting.  I don't see a problem with you all coming up September 5/6 to drop everything off and I'm sure we can figure out some indoor space, either in our shop building or shipping container, for temporary storage of a pallet (or whatever) of materials.  I will be back, briefly, during August 28-29th, so I can make sure all of us at BBCRC are on the same page regarding location. Will the water tower be coming up at the same time?  And I guess that increases the overall footprint needed, right?

Please keep in mind that September 1-4 is the ""No Mans Land"" (women/queer only) get together at BBCRC so the 5th is the earliest it would be appropriate for you all to come up. Sounds like that isn't an issue anyways.  I would imagine that on the 5th/6th of Sept there will still be lots of people around who can help with unloading etc.

For the set up in October, as I mentioned the work party is October 13-15 and that would be a great time to do it with lots of hands on deck. However, if for some reason that weekend Doesn't work for you all, the previous weekend is also possible. We have a music show (honky tonk from Asheville, NC, Hearts Gone South) on Saturday night so there will be some people around....but overall the work party weekend would be best.

Anyway, I'm on the road today, Winona out to the Finger Lakes of New York State, and can talk more about this soon.  Good luck with the set-up, it looks like it will be an awesome display out in the desert!","Yes, water tower as well. Work weekend sounds good. Trailer is covered by art project budget."
,I'm about to go out the door to go swimming. How about tomorrow late morning or early afternoon?,Sure. Text me when you are ready.
,"Hey how things going?  I haven't really broached this with our board yet. I think the two of us might want to have a phone call about it first just to see what the parameters would be....like if it would be ""on loan"" or a permanent installation.....also how involved/expensive the transportation would be, whether you would have an ongoing role with it (which I would welcome!), all that stuff....
",Sounds good. What's a good time for you?
,"Howdy,
I saw your post on reddit about collaborating with art projects and theme
camps. My artwork involves 12 grandfather clocks decorated to explore
different ideas about time. I didn't get a chance to see the station last
year, but I am excited to get a 2nd chance to check it out this year!
I understand the project involves alternative timelines, so I feel like
there is a great opportunity to interweave the two projects! One of the
clocks is themed ""Time Travel"" so I was wondering if you had any train
tickets, maps or train schedules that I could incorporate into the clock
decoration. Participants could take the ticket as a clue to go find the
Black Rock Train station.
I would love to make some small artwork for Betsy as well, maybe a little
sundial or something?
Thanks for making the playa amazing! Can't wait to finally take a ride on
the BRC railroad!

were they?

idea how long it will be until you get back? maybe you can just burn the
station. thinking of you.","The former is true. We are no longer stuck in the desert eating each other.

We saw the man burn. It was a great fireworks show, but didn't dance around
the flames this time. We saw the temple burn from up on top of the
container. The weather was friendly and eventually dried the earth to a
churned-up mess of deep footprints threatening to turn your ankle with
every step.

 It was a long haul out with a skeleton crew, but it is done. The station
(and Camp Blarg) packed up and put away. The station delivered to its new home
in a pile that we need to put together in a month or so.

How about you? You return to some uncertainty? Selling the house. No more
Homewood? Homestyle? Homeslice? What Does life look like for you now?

I had such a good time spending time with you at the burn. Hearing where
you were at, listening to your stories. You are a special one, Sam."

anything."
,"Thanks for writing and although I am replying for Supervisor McPherson, he
will be made aware of this email exchange.
You are not the first constituent who has suggested such an approach to
County fees.  The County must charge fees for “cost recovery” because we do
not get enough tax revenue to cover the costs of our staff to implement the
required State and Federal regulations.    The seasonal creek is
complicating the issue because those regulations are more complex than
simply getting a building permit.  The general problem of the State and
Federal government deciding regulations that are enforced by local
government without providing a funding stream to cover the necessary
resources is a large problem that goes back decades.  You probably have
heard the phrase “unfunded mandates”.  It applies to so many aspects of our
local government functions that we must charge for “cost recovery” not only
building permit fees, but for many other infrastructure-type services we
provide.
Sorry this is not the answer you seek.  Your situation is not unique.  The
costs for fire rebuild and general property improvements such as in your
case are going up expodentially, as is the cost of homeowner’s/fire
insurance.  What used to be affordable is becoming increasingly
unaffordable.  I hope the cost recovery fees do not add up to 20% of your
project when all is said and done.
Best regards,","Thanks for the reply. I appreciate your passing my message on to our Supervisor.

While I understand ""cost recovery,"" that cost should be distributed
proportionally to the project size. Thus, a discretionary permit for a
small project might be less than one for a larger project. Across-the-board
fees are always a disproportionate burden on those with fewer resources."

clothing they are giving away that direct people to the station. We talked
to the BRC Passport Arthurncy to maybe provide envelopes for our postal boxes

Hi friends,

Larnie's birthday is next week, and since we couldn't swing a party for his 40th birthday last year thanks to a sick chihuahua with a flair for the dramatic, he has graciously acquiesced to an informal shindig this year.

The idea is simple: meet at Dust Bowl for drinks, taco truck treats, and conversation. Bring your partners, kids, and dogs, along with a healthy appetite for baked goods. NO PRESENTS (please and thank you).

We look forward to celebrating with you!",Thank you. I miss you both. I am sending my regrets since I will just have finished teaching in Santa Cruz at seven.
,"Had to wait out a good weather window to paddle across Dixon Entrance to
Alaska. Here the inside passage opens up to the swell of the open
pacific, pulsing its tides in and out of the labyrinthine channels. I
attempted a sunrise crossing, before the winds built, but it was already
blowing half a gale and the swell was stacking up against the strong ebb
of freshwater pouring out of the coast mountains, making for
sloppy-choppy seas on the beam threatening capsize. With the deck awash,
I turned and made a run back to bail out on a beach I spotted on the BC
side. Hauled out and filled up my solar shower bag as the sun rose. By
the afternoon the winds had anomalously gone calm, the sea glassy, and
as I hung my shower bag up in the branches and enjoyed my first warm
water since the hotsprings of Gardner Canal, I was lured into making a
run for Alaska.
Conditions held for the big crossing and I wondered if the distant
vessel was border patrol coming to bother me. As I neared it turned out
to be a fishing vessel straddling the invisible line between two made up
countries, and just as I was straddling that fictitious boundary, the
wind began blasting against me. I dug in hard to make the last stretch
to the islands and was forced to duck into a channel I hadn’t intended
to take. On the island’s lee side, I couldn’t find a single beach at
that low tide level to land on, but spied a distant estuary on the
mainland that looked landable. One more sprint across the wind and I
would be there.

As I passed a cove I peeked in, and there was an enormous beached
humpback whale being devoured by a brown bear! The wind was blowing me
into the cove, but I back paddled to behold the sight. It looked so, so
chewy. The mighty grizzly’s jowls were struggling to tear off each
blubbery bite. Thankfully, I was upwind of the rotting whale stench, but
my solar shower must not have hosed down my own stink too well, because
eventually the bear pulled its face out of the cetacean carcass and
caught my scent on the wind. It paused a moment, then scrambled off into
the forest. 

Now the beach I was trying to land on was a short distance from the
bear, but I figured what self-respecting brown bear would go after my
rice and lentils when there was an entire whale on the menu? So I made a
landing at last and given that it was a clear night and the bugs weren’t
out yet in mid-may, I didn’t bother with the tent and slept under the
stars. 

Somewhere in the few short hours of northern night, I woke up in a
primal scream as a big animal crunched the gravel just a leap and a
bound away. Typically I would sing at wildlife to announce my presence
in a non-threatening way, but this was more of a terrorized shrieking
than a song. In most scenarios, bears take off running as soon as I make
noise, but this thing just froze. I was in a bad habit of not having my
bear spray and headlight handy, so I was fumbling in my dry bags as my
voise went hoarse. Finally found them and shone the light—not a bear,
but a wolf!
Once the light was on it, the wolf took off for the woods. It stopped in
the cover of treeline and I could see its eyes bouncing the light back
at me. So I shut off the light and took a calming breath, then began
singing it a song as the high tide touched the shore just below me. In
the song I apologized to the wolf for screaming at it so much, “sorry, I
was scared, you were probably scared too.”  My song ended and after just
a moment of quiet, the entire wolf pack went up in a howling chorus. I
joined in the howl and blended our voices. The last wolf fell into
profound silence and I lay under the stars, coursing with too much
adrenaline to sleep. On a rare cloudless night on the northwest coast, I
watched the biggest and brightest burn I have ever seen streak across
the sky, some celestial fallen angel burning up on its way to earth.

Dawn came and I was packing up again to continue the sleepless
marathon. As I packed, a single wolf came trotting down the beach and
stopped to regard me. Another song and it ambled off, then I heard the
whole pack howl again over by where I had seen the whale. Breakfast. 

I continued up the coast and ended my day at the abandoned barge landing
that once served the tree point lighthouse. Supplies were loaded onto a
raised narrow gauge rail tramway, now being swallowed by the rainforest.
I bushwhacked along the couple miles of trestle, testing ties before
committing my weight to them. I reached the lighthouse with its
inscribed date of 1904. It has long stood abandoned, watching over the
last section of open coast before the protection of the inside passage
resumes. I climbed to the tippy top of the lighthouse and looked out
over the last broken reaches of the north American continent. The
islands give way to the endless glittering pacific. The sea steadily
breathes, patiently sculpting the land, offering its dead leviathans to
drift ashore and feed the myriad creatures.",Absolutely banging story.

,"Always nice to hear from you - particular news or not!
Great to hear about Black Rock's reception - wow, amazing it stood out so
much to folks. Congrats, and thanks for letting me be involved! Am I right
that it wound up somewhere longer term now, too?
That project sounds very cool. Let me know if I can help. Could be fun to
put together some new music to fit if that's of interest - or whatever, of
course. Always on board for anything you need.
I'm on sabbatical right now. Though honestly, it hasn't been as
work-productive as I'd planned, but it's been good without that. Biggest
current project is an installation with Tim Orme (cinema faculty - we've
done a bunch of projects together). He's got abstract, but
local-environment-inspired animations for multiple screens, and I'm working
on a generative system to create responsive, changing music for it. There's
a little musical/music video project with him in the works, too. Otherwise,
there are a few engineering things in the works, and I need to get some of
my own music wrapped up for release, too.
Most of the productivity at the moment has been applying for other jobs,
though. Our (fortunately now) previous dean consolidated our department
with Visual and Public Art and slashed a lot of functional, but inexpensive
resources (lost one of the two department admin support staff and a chair
position). She tried to do it w/ like three weeks notice last spring, and
pushback from us, the whole college, and donors only got us a super
contentious and unproductive summer of meetings that just resulted in her
pushing her original plan through. It was all very demoralizing, made the
job worse, and just further undermined my faith in the admins above her,
too. So, I started applying. Waiting to hear from one spot I had an
in-person interview, and I head out for another on Sunday. One more
application just in a couple weeks ago, too. So, we'll see what comes
through, but I'll probably keep applying if nothing comes through this
cycle, too. Feels like CSUMB is a sinking ship and small departments (esp.
ours) are the lower decks, unfortunately.","Wow, I'm sorry to hear about your department's situation. previously, you
were the only CSUMB faculty I'd met who had great things to say.  I'm sorry
to note that your experience here is completely consistent with my 5 years
at CSUMB. Hav you looked at UCSC? I think there are some music positions?
Or were? I've been talking occasionally with Bush about a new
department which I'd like to remain involved in.

The creative projects you are doing sound cool. What personal projects were
you hoping to do while on sabbatical?

I'll keep you updated about the sound project. I'm a long way, I think,
from generating any sound.  But we'll see."

how it ends up. We have worked with PlayaRPG in the past.
We have 2 alleys, almost 30 spaces, mobile offerings, performances.
Whatever you think would work let me know and we can make it happen.","Is there a bar that has random items behind the bar that maybe visitors
could take a look at?  I was thinking we could put a mailbox combination
inside the door of a toy boxcar at one of the bars at Golden Guy. That
would allow visitors to request to examine the railcar and get the combo.
That would lead them to the next clue in the mailbox."
,"Here’s a list of our camp scheudle for the week, let us know if anything
comes to mind based off our shenanagins for the week:
[image: image0.png]
Cheers,","We don't really know what the puzzlebox looks like. It's not really our
thing, but everyone was so sure we'd made one, we figure we wanted to add
another layer of complexity to keep visitors engaged, and if it encouraged
interaction with other camps/pieces we loved, it would be a big win.

For example, on our community board, there's a postcard of Toyko's Golden
Gai alley and on the back it suggests they seek the ""feathered box."" At one
of Golden Guy's bars, we have a toy boxcar with the Western Pacific feather
logo. If they look inside, there's a combo to one of our mailboxes.  Inside
THAT there is a letter that sends them to Plunderground where after some
fooling about there is Black Rock Station swag available. That kind of
thing is easy enough, gives some folks a quest that allows them to meet
people, and completing the quest is unimportant.

We will definitely drop by and grab a few ""TimButts"" stickers. And we'll
try to make the opening ceremony. Our opening ceremony is the next morning
and unfortunately directly corresponds to the Tim Whoreton's opening.

I'm looking forward to working and playing with y'all. Any other ways we
can complicate things?

We'd love to have y'all at the Black Rock Station 85th Anniversary
Celebration and Rededication 10am to noon, August 28th. Champagne will be
served. If you have a moment to visit, during build week we'll be working
at the station from sunup until dinner. After that, we'll be kicking it at
the Camp Blarg burn barrel."
,"What ideas are you thinking of?
I saw the email and it presented as a generic template and not specific to
our camp, The email asked for our camp's ideas, but none were proposed by
you that specifically pertained to our camp, No ReGretzkys. If you have
specifics please share, but like you mentioned, during this crunch time I
don't have time to brainstorm :)
Will cc co-leads if they have more bandwidth.
Thanks for your understanding,","We love ReGretzkys. It was part of our catholic school girl night at Camp Blarg
in 2019.

We are familiar with your main schtick but don't know what secret depths
y'all might be up to, so that's why we didn't come with a solid proposal,
only a desire to play with camp friends we love.

It might be too late to concoct something if nothing comes immediately to
mind. If you have something as simple as a camp postcard, we can put it up
on the community board to encourage people to find ReGretskys."

,"I am happy to announce that this year's International Taco Fortnight starts at 12:01am on this coming Saturday, October 21st and goes until 11:59pm on Saturday, November 4th! As usual, I am not here to tell you how to celebrate. Eat tacos! Or don't! If anyone would like to have a meal with me, I will have general availability for many dinner and lunch times. There will be a 2-week-long conference/arts festival in the other timeline. This year's theme is Holding Each Other: Nourishing Peace. 

And I am looking for some expression of potential interest in helping with a procession of the Fabrica protest banners. The 50th anniversary of the timeline split is in November, so this is the first event of the upcoming anniversary year. The plan for the banner procession is to meet up at the Fabrica at 5pm on Halloween, then--since Pacific Avenue will be blocked off--to process down towards the Clock Tower carrying the banners in an order appropriate for the Aulinta timeline. So, the first banner will be Capitalism is Killing Us, and the last will be Decolonize Everything. To carry all the banners we will need about 30 people and I really hope some of you can take a moment between your other Halloween plans for this event. If you are interested in this, please let me know. You can text me at 831.254.9048 if that is easier. 

I hope to see you soon!

,"Just tried to call you.  Your voice mail isn’t accepting messages.  

I’ll be available until 1:20.  Let me know by email if you are.","Oh Connie, I'm sorry. I was looking forward to talking to you. I took a nap when my granddaughter went down for a nap and missed our call. (I've been sleeping an awful lot lately.). Is there another time that works?"

Take good care.","Thank goodness. We could play phone tag forever. 

Does 1pm sound okay?"
,"Thanks, it was an attempt at a joke along the lines of when the Southern Pacific was merged into the Union Pacific. The joke on SP was that UP agreed to keep the first half of their own name for the newly combined railroad (Union) and the second half of the SP's (Pacific). Hence the combined railroad was called ""Union Pacific.""

What I meant was that we might want to eventually change the name of the station to Black Butte instead of Black Rock (keeping the first half of its existing name and adding the second part of our name....just a feeble joke).

A couple of our board members (including Brian Lewis who is a Burner and visited BRS last year) asked about why BRS was painted in SP depot color instead of WP. Personally I like SP colors and thought BRS looks great the way it was painted. Brian used to work for WP and said some sort of ""psychedelic blue"" would have been more accurate haha.","I like the joke. We'd be happy to help create a new sign. 

The short answer is that the SP colors are more iconic. The longer answer is that Western Pacific, unlike SP, didn't have uniform branding, an authoritative color recipe, and a color swatch book that came with every build or remodel. So it was technically possible for a WP station to have colors similar to SP. 

We'd love to include the signal bridge since it has working lights."
,We would probably want to keep the first part of the name of the station and replace the last part with our own name.,"The signal bridge is at 12 ft which is slightly smaller than the minimum 14ft. 

I'll work up some costs by next week."

This is being sent to multiple people that hold a special place in our hearts.

Penny! and I are separating. We love each other, and are best friends, so this is very hard.

For 12 years, Penny! has done everything to support me with my mental health issues. Even though I was convinced that I was shielding her from what I was going through, I realize now that she was aware of every bit of it, and it was devastating to her. She did everything to make me happy, tried to get me to do something, anything, that might help. Convinced that nothing would ever help me, I gave up on trying. This has eaten away at Pam! to the point that if we don't separate, we are afraid I will drag her down into my hole.

I looked outside myself and now know how awful it must've been for Pam! to see me in pain day after day, and to hear me say that I didn't believe things would ever change.She once told me how she was nervous when she drove home from work because she never knew if she would find me dead or alive. No one should have to go through that.

So what's next?

Well, next week, our house goes up for sale. Pam! will get an apartment with our dog Kermit. As for me, I discovered that there is a place about 40 minutes away called Homewood Health Centre. I was absolutely shocked that places like it existed. I have been referred by my doctor and am now in the process of becoming a patient. I will live there for a few months, get assessed, have therapy, learn coping skills, and possibly even be able to have my medication changed under close supervision. I have heard many success stories from Homewood patients and I hope to join them.

I can't begin to explain how badly I wanted to go to the burn this year. I was salivating at the thought of it. However, there is a 99% chance that I will be in Homewood at that time.

While the sale of our house will probably close while I'm away, once I an released will be couch surfing until I find a place. I've never lived on my own, so this should be intersting. 

Over 30 years, I have lost everything to my illness. School, work, friends - no match for it. Now I have lost my home, my best friend, the love of my life, and the opportunity to see you, my chosen family. That being said, I have been presented with an amazing opportunity to finally, hopefully, get the dedicated treatment that I need.

This is very hard on us, but we know it needs to be done. It would be easier to just stay together, but then, in the long run, we would lose ourselves. 

We don't know what the future holds, there are so many variables, but no matter what, we want each other to be happy and healthy. 

I hope to be able to send out updates of our journey, whether that be together or separate. 

We love you all so much. We miss you, and are so sorry we won't be seeing you this year. You are always welcome to come visit ""beautiful"" Kitchener-Waterloo ; ) 

Thank you for everything. 


P.S. If it comes up, feel free to tell people what is going on, it's not a secret, but not something we wanted to send to the list. If you tell someone we are seperating, please make sure to tell them why. ","Sam, I love you so much. Your spirit, your playfulness, your humor, I treasure them and you inspire me. 

I am happy that you have found possible treatment that gives you a glimmer of hope. And of course sad about changes. 

I can't wait to see you. And I really loved this update because it was so honest and so raw and so real. Thank you for sharing that."

,"I think you've got it. When presented with direct feedback about how his
actions have impacted others, Pete tends to go full DARVO
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARVO> or launches into lengthy
explanations and justifications for his actions - while totally
disregarding the (often significant) impact his behaviours have had on
others. This, I think, is the core of the problem. My take on Pete's
challenges in dealing with women are that he sees them mainly as objects to
serve his own gratification, and although he describes himself as
""brutality honest"" he is actually a very poor communicator, particularly
when it comes to expressing sexual desire. A fear of rejection tends to
cause him to become intoxicated before he's comfortable enough to tell
someone that he's into them, and is then often surprised when people don't
want to fuck creepy drunk Pete. So he has then retaliated by withdrawing
shower privileges (Margie) or engaging with them in other unwelcome and
coercive ways (Leslie). While Pete has many redeeming qualities and is has
been a well-organized and community-minded contributor, these problematic
behavioural patterns and ongoing refusal to address them has brought us all
to this point where he is no longer welcome amongst us.","I also know that he worked on softening up Arthur last year who then asked me
what the deal was. So this is not a dead issue for Pete.

To summarize, Pete is unwelcome at Camp Blarg for several reasons, including:

   - Being generally skeezy around women, including unwelcome, punitive,
   and coercive behavior
   - Discomfort with his shower arrangement in which he insisted that
   everyone must shower naked, uncovered, and in full view of him
   - Defensiveness, aggressiveness, and playing the victim when these
   concerns were brought to him
   - Disregarding the camp's boundaries about no longer coming into camp
   - Dishonesty after coming into camp anyway
   - Repeatedly attempting to rally support from people who were not there
   or were neutral
   - Refusing to hear, acknowledge, and take responsibility for any of
   these actions repeatedly over nearly 10 years

,"I’m into that, although it would be great if the message somehow
instructed people in a way that routed them through our museum. Like if
they had to use the interactive phone to get the message that they needed
to tell to the bartender in order to get the swag.","Can the phone be programmed to give people a pass phrase? Because the note
can certainly direct them to go to the phone."
,"Hi there!
I'm with the museum at Plunderground, located at Rod's Road and 2:00 this
year (formerly in the 4:30 portal). We would love to collaborate with you,
and have many elements of our camp that could be ripe for opportunity.
A little overview of our camp: We have two large flower-themed flame
effect sculptures at our frontage that draw people in from the street. One
of them is a flaming zen garden, the other is a bunch of sunflowers with a
propane ceiling effect, which invites you to lay underneath and look up at
them. Our museum consists of several rooms full of interactive oddities,
including an Augmented Reality Sandbox. From our bar, a hidden passageway
inside a wardrobe leads to the entrance to our four story tower.
So we have several places where we could hide messages that lead to other
clues. Like:
The bottom of the sandbox
Inside the wardrobe
Under the sunflowers so you only see it when you lay down
There is also an interactive phone in the museum, which will play a
different message when you press each number. One of our messages can be
dedicated to delivering a clue
These are just some barebones ideas, but I'm interested in hearing if you
think this would be a good collaboration, or have any ideas for how to dial
in the experience. Looking forward to chatting about it!","perhaps in the
mailboxes or on the community board, that cryptically directs people to

So I have been in Homewood for 2 weeks. This place is great. People are wonderful, the classes are helpful, and the food is fantastic. There is no way I'm leaving here without, at least, 20 extra pounds. ; )

I am in the ASU/CPC unit. ASU (which I am in) is the assessment group. After 1-3 weeks, they decide whether to send you to a different unit, or go to CPC, which is seamless since you are already there. We are broken up into 4 colour coded blocks (aka groups) and then there are two phases (aka levels) of classes, the first is 3 weeks, the second is 5. Everything is on a weekly schedule; classes, gym time, music therapy, horticulture therapy, ceramics, creative arts, etc. Then you will have appointments with your assigned psychiatrist, nurse practitioner, social worker, recreation therapist, at least once a week. Sometimes the meetings are at the same time as your class, but you will still get the handouts and another patient will catch you up to speed. At 415pm each day we have ""check-in"", where we take turns saying our name, what group we are in (Yellow rules!), our current mood, a coping skill we used in the past day, a positive for the day, and what our evening plans are. The first Tuesday I was here, I said my positive was that this would be the first time in 15+ years where I didn't have Taco Club™, but I didn't feel devastated or that the world would end. Later on, another patient came up to me and asked if I had had dinner yet, I said I hadn't, and he said ""I ordered tacos, I can't have you missing Taco Club™"". That evening I had tears in my eyes while I ate my tacos. Taco Bell never tasted so good! Since then I decided that I would host Taco Club™ every Tuesday. This past one was my ""proof of concept"", with myself and one other person. I look forward to future weeks.

I had a few days where my mood was *very* low, which included a psychotic breakdown, but the nurses are on top of that. Apparently, I have very high blood pressure, so they started me on a medication for that (which helps ease my worry of getting sick on playa). Besides that, after a bunch of trial and error, it looks like we may have found the right combo of medications to get me to actually sleep at night. The past couple of nights have been somewhat restful, so that's huge.

Meanwhile, my life outside of Homewood continues to go forward without me, and is not exactly turning out as I would have hoped. Our house was listed three times before it sold, and so we ended up accepting quite a bit less than I would've liked. Very fitting that the papers came in for me to sign right in the middle of the psychotic break, the next day I didn't even remember the deal went through.

The house has a later closing date than originally expected, so I might be out of Homewood with 1-4 weeks to stay in the house, pack and find a place to live. (I know that last part won't happen and I am lucky to have a few friends offer me a place to stay until I find a place to live).

It's hard, I have at least 6 more weeks, but I also can't help but worry what I will be going back to. My life will be completely different. I am hoping the skills I learn here will help me with my new life, but the worrying is somewhat distracting me from learning those skills.

All of my anxiety is around that new life. There's the obvious: where will I live? Can I live on my own? Will I ever get a job? How will I afford things when the house money runs out? Will I go to burningman this year? Ever again? There are others as well: Will my friends forget me while I'm away? Will they stop caring? What will happen with Pam! and I? Does she resent me for skipping out on life to come here? Does she hate me? Is she indifferent to me? Does this situation upset her as much as it Does me? At all? I can't stop thinking that I will lose not only my biggest supporter, but my entire support group. And am I an asshole for seeing my friends as something that should support and help me?

I try my best to focus on what I am doing here and now, and I usually succeed. Other than that, I just need to wait for the class that teaches me the skills I can use to get rid of those thoughts.

I really hope I didn't end this email on too much of a bummer. Things are really good here, and I am slowly starting to look forward to the future.

I love you all,","Thanks for this update. It means a ton to know how you are and how you are doing (highs and lows). I absolutely love all the details. Please keep sending these.

,"The original rail ran from Ventura up Ventura Canyon (roughly following
route 33) to Mira Monte and then into Ojai. It looks like the old right of
way has been turned into a gorgeous walking/biking trail. Going north, just
past Casitas Springs near where 33 crosses San Antoniaa Creek, 33 goes NE
and the rail line goes NW splitting around the plateau, The rail line takes
a leisurely route up to Mira Monte and 33 jumps up out of the canyon to Oak
View. But interestingly, the rail line could have gone the other way and
followed San Antonio Creek through your property.
So a plausible place for a station is along an imaginary track coming up
Lion Canyon either along San Antonio Creek or up from the backside.","Sorry to fill your inbox this morning. Just having fun with research before
my classes do their final presentations.

Fun fact 1: The Ojai railroad was completed in 1898 so a historically
accurate station would be from that era.

Fun fact 2: Ojai was called Nordhoff at that time. So the station could
sport a sign saying Nordhoff."
,"Hey Wes -
Thanks for getting back to me.
Electricity is definitely an issue - solar an option? Is electricity
imperative to the stations?","The original had interior lighting that represented a few different eras
from the 1930s when it was built to the 1980s of its narrative frame (that
would cycle depending on the era the train was in), and exterior lighting
on the outside at the doors and at the ends where the Black Rock City signs
were.

Additionally, the signals, crossing, TV, and Ticket Office radio (playing
content appropriate for the era the station was in) all used power.

We had it all running off a Honda 2200 generator, so the power requirements
aren't that high. Did you see the water tank and the billboard that we had
in 2023?  The water tank was created to give us a good place to put
the generator. It had a secret bar on the inside that you entered through
the base.

Solar could be an option, it has a roof that could be used for solar
(though that would definitely change the aesthetics), or a solar array
could be sighted a ways away."
,"I'm writing because I'm developing a performance to be presented in
mixed-reality and I'm going to do a Kickstarter for the project.   I have
never done this before and I wonder if you have any advice about best
practices, etc?
I'm sure you're quite busy.  If you have time to write back or if you'd
prefer a call I'd really appreciate it.
Warmly,","Oh man, that is a big topic for sure. Lemme give my quick pointers just
poured out like syrup.

   - Kickstarter, since it is all or nothing, has a sense of drama and so
   is more likely to be successful.
   - Don't do a fundraising period longer than 30 days.  20 days is
   probably even better, but you will work like hell within those 20 days.
   - People generally don't fund Kickstarter for swag, but the swag may
   help push them over the edge to support your project
   - Provide lots of levels of funding from the $5 (just want to provide a
   token to express my support or keep getting updates) to $500 or higher
   (have lots of money and throwing around this much is really not much of a
   big deal for me)
   - Write a GOOD STORY on your pitch page, well organized, photos or
   diagrams, funding sources, and how the money will be spent
   - Give lots of updates on how the project is going (Im told no one cares
   how the fundraiser is going but people love behind-the-scenes stuff about
   the project)
   - People often don't care so much about the rewards but just want to be
   involved - think beyond just boring old STUFF, and about creative rewards
   that allow people to be more involved (send a postcard or art to US, be
   part of a performance, write a scene in a performance, blog or tweet about
   the campaign, etc)
   - If the campaign is really interesting, do a Reddit AMA

That should get you started!"
,"So, I think Steve told you yesterday that I had a ticket confirmed for the burn? Maybe not quite accurate, but he didn't know that at the time. 

I emailed Marcella yesterday asking to lock in the ticket she was holding for me, and she asked if I could check with you first. I didn't know you were holding a ticket for me, but she says you are! If it's already claimed, Marcella says she Does have one for me, but her preference is if I can ask you first. That is kind of my preference to get a ticket related to the Station because it'd be awesome to come in early, work my butt off for a week building the Station (or doing food support--wherever you need me is fine) and then I won't feel obligated to do Camp Blarg shifts during burn week (although I might anyway...). 

So, basically where I'm at is that I'm feeling VERY confident that I'm going to be able to get the time off work. It's not ""in the bag"" yet, but I'm confident enough that I think I should lock down a ticket. :)  Let me know how much and who I need to pay?

Looking forward to getting dusty with you. ","Woah, so you think you might be able to come in early? Do you think you can make it in with Steve? 

Basically, I have a ticket for a person who will help Dill on the crew care team. I was hoping that person would be you, because Dill loves working with you, and I would love to have you on the station team. In fact, on the spreadsheet it's your name there."
,"Hey folks,
I imagine many of you haven't yet finished dusting things off from BRC, or
processed & integrated the whole experience. But here we are again, still
deep in debriefing but also launching the 2023 cycle. If you can't even
think about 2023 then stop reading and know how grateful we are for
everything you did this year. If you just can't get enough - read on!","Question for you: We'd always intended for Black Rock Station to have a
two-year tenure in Black Rock City. This year our intention is to dig
deeper into the historical mythos, physical details, and sustainability of
the piece.  How precedented is it to fund the same piece over two
consecutive years with an honorarium?

Or asking in a more direct way, what advice do you have for us applying for
an honorarium while extending Black Rock Station both outwardly and
inwardly?"
,"Good Morning,
I reviewed the claim you submitted and that you prefer to be contacted via
email.  I have been assigned the claim you filed for water damages.  In the
reporting notes it states that water entered several structures, are all of
these your structures and if so what kind of structures are they?  Did the
water enter your main home?  Were you unable to live in the home?  If you
have any photos can you please email them to me?
Thank you,","I know you are probably dealing with people who have serious and extensive
damage to their home. We are not really one of those. In our case, moisture
entered a detached guest room and the basement rooms in our main house.
Everything was really damp necessitating the need for buying an extra
heater and a dehumidifier. We were not displaced. I don't have any photos
sorry to say. we just observed the problem and then took steps to solve it.

Much more worrying to me is that the retaining walls in the stream behind
our house collapsed during the storm. This potentially endangers our home
in the next storm. I would like to rebuild and reinforce those walls when
it dries out a little. I have plenty of those photos."
,"We are working on getting our T’shirts printed for the burn!!!  And have
the opportunity to print different garments this year, if you are

,"We would like to throw our hat in the ring in case anyone needs
translations or conversations in either Spanish or Mandarin.
Both myself and co-lead Iyvone are bilingual and fluent in said languages
(a bit of cantonese too) and happy to help.
We don’t want anyone to miss out.
If anyone needs this please get in contact.
Keep up the good work.","Thanks for your offer! Interestingly, those are precisely the languages for
which we needed translation when we were creating the announcements for
Black Rock Station last year."
,"Hello I hope today finds you blessed and well 
I was intrigued by your bucket of chain, One look and it made my heart pitter patter....I began thinking of all the things I could create with it...
The list was...well small....I like small things, Like puppies, and kittens, small jars of anything, the tiny miniature condiments you get when you travel...yes I thought what could I make...
1. Nothing

So now I ask you with great enthusiasm and so much hope that you respond with a YES....is this bucket o Chain still available? 

Always in HOPE","Alas, the dreamy bucket o chains has found a new forever home."
,"Wes, I'd like to accept your offer with humility and gratitude.
I have family visiting from out of state today, so responses will be brief
until they leave.
I'll take a look at the guide and email you again tomorrow.",That's great news. I'm excited.
,"Thank you so much for the thoughts about my cat.  I raised him from 6
weeks to 15 years, and you're right, he loved me / was loved more than any
human in my life.
As for Burning Man, this sounds like a once in a lifetime opportunity.  It
feels like Destiny.  2 weeks is sorta perfect, 1 week to acclimate and 1
week to connect with thousands of artists.
If you want me, I have to do this.  I'm In.
I'll be driving from Atlanta.  This will take about 4 days.  Therefore, I
don't think I should come all the way to Santa Cruz, CA.  But we can
capture your arrival and the setup of course.
My gigs line up perfectly date-wise, I don't have a pet to care for, and
I've been wanting to do this since 2011.
I'll block off my schedule now!","Thanks, Daniel.

That all sounds great. Lemme get some feedback from the crew and I'll get
back to you probably tomorrow. Feel free to ask if you have questions.

On the shantyboat, the first rule for new shipmates to their surprise is
""The captain is not always right."" I always say I never want to be swimming
away from a sinking ship only to have a shipmate say, ""I wondered about
that.""

So feel free to ask any and all questions you may have.

An additional note, is that all drones have to be registered with the
Burning Man Org (mostly so everyone's experience isn't saturated with
drones flying all over the goddamn place). It used to be (and maybe still
is) requested that pro photogs register with media mecca. I'll get more
info about that for you if we move forward."
,"So, this would be a 3 week ish project?  And I'd spend 2 weeks filming
your setup, and then it's 1 week of BM?
You're correct, I'd want to go explore the festival and capture some
amazing short videos.  However, I also have a strong work ethic and a sense
of duty.
I could commit 2-3 hours a day to filming your installation exclusively,
during BM.
Before BM starts, we could do some incredible timelapses and b-roll of the
installation being assembled and do interviews, or whatever you like,
before the masses arrive.  I have audio gear, lighting, etc.
Fwiw I have the kit for this already:  camping stove(s), water bins,
foldable sleeping mattress, 2 tents, bicycle, LED lights.
Let me know what you think!  I'm excited by the opportunity.
--Daniel","I think two weeks. While we are doing stuff to prep, I'm not sure we'd need
to document much of that. Though the thought of documenting packing up and
loading the trailer opens up possibilities.

So I have a free ticket, a Work Access Pass (WAP) for Monday 8/21, and a
vehicle pass for the videographer crew member. If you wanted to join us in
Santa Cruz for a few days before we left and caravan up with us, that'd be
great.

I always do my best to pay all the artists/crew at the end, but it is more
of an honorarium and is drawn from the money left over at the end of the
project (though artist/crew honoraria are budgeted). 

In practice that gets divided proportionally to the work crew members put
into the project. The pool could be more than that, or it could be zero (if
I'm sucking at budgeting).

All of the rest of the crew are already involved in a theme camp,
Camp Blarg Soulmate Trading Outlet and will be participating in that during
event week. Obviously, out videographer would camp and eat with us during
Build Week (Aug 21 - Aug 27) but would be on their own for Event Week (Aug
28 to Sep 4). Though I hope we'd see lots of you and plan some shoots.

I don't think you'll be spending thousands.

So far, how Does that sound?"
,"AND you're working a project about America's Rivers?
I am always working on a video about a River, lol
the Chattahoochee is full of SEWAGE and E. Coli.  Yuck.","All true. Perpetual project for the last nine years.

My only concern is that for your first year, do wanna be tied down to
working on one project? You're going to want to explore the world and get
lost and meet people and photograph and go crazy. We've experienced that
after 25 years of Camp Blarg, our burgins have inevitable early-onset ADHD.
What are your thoughts?"
,"Will we have power at the station or at least at 360 for recharging? Or
should we bring a Genny?
Can we list out what need to happen?
Are we all going in the truck or am I driving too?","We can all go in the truck if you like.

We should bring the genny.

I'll make a list of things we need to do, and things we need to bring
tomorrow."
,"Great to hear from you.
No shifts in the department, but Parch was new last year & he's gotten his
feet under him so to speak, and he has lots of enthusiasm and ideas.

And woah yes please I would love to join you for dinner! We've barely met
in person and I would really enjoy that. Thank you!","And wait, last year was Parch' first year? Talk about hit the ground
running! He was amazing."
,"And Wes I like your idea, and there is something similar on the Burning
Man website. We have this Support a Project
page that lists all the art projects that are actively fundraising (both
Honoraria & registered artists). So depending on how broad you want to go,
that's another place to refer folks to. (Also if any of you are actively
fundraising & not currently included on that page, submit a short form
here
I know fundraising can be a challenging part of this process & I wish you
all well!
xo","Thanks, Kalli!

I noticed Parch is doing a lot more this year. Are things shifting about in
your department?

Also, would you like to have dinner with the station crew (camped at
Camp Blarg) some night during build week? Usually, we eat extremely well. Last
year's menu included lasagne and pad thai."
,"Hereby I sent you the photos of black rock station that I took when I

person you replaced was going to come up with us. But I'll work it out.
Your VP will get you on to the playa where you will simply park your car

,"Excellent, thank you. Probably also need a manual for the Black Rock Station, so that we know how to do it correctly.

I finally got free and walked around 360, and just love the artwork, so surreal & wonderful. Thank you again for the leap of faith and believing in us.","I’ll definitely put together a manual. Glad you enjoyed it.

,"I just wanted to report back from the Santa Cruz city worker strike. I am there now and the energy is electric!  As you may know, a few weeks ago workers were poised to strike when they came to a last minute tentative agreement with the city.  The agreement was for less than the rank and file had been demanding and so workers overwhelmingly voted to reject the contract and go out on strike after all.  That strike began on Monday and has only been gaining steam!  The main issue has to do with the city paying its workers far less than other cities in our region, leading to high turnover, understaffing and consequently, unsafe working conditions. 

I encourage y'all to come downtown if you have a chance and meet some of these awesome and militant workers who make our city run.  There has been a good showing of folks from other unions--UAW, Teamsters, CFT, etc.  It would be great to have more UC-AFT folks there! The picket line starts each morning at 7am at a few different locations throughout the city.  It is currently set to go through the week.

Hey guys. 

The area for the foundation was leveled today. I sourced five 14'.8"" utility pole sections, and four 4' sections. We are good to go with all of that.

Wes, do you suggest we still use pressure treated joists under the deck and on the utility poles? 

I also took the initiative and hardscaped some boulders in the southeast corner, which is probably for more erosion. I can ask my buddy to come back and add more boulders but I would need to get that approved first. I was thinking boulders in the two easterns corners and RR ties in between as an abutment. Anyways that could be a work party thing too. 

Thx ","Good work. I have a few questions:

What is the diameter of the telephone poles? Are they all consistent diameter?

What are the exact measurements of the decks so I can amend the plans?

8 inches is the recommended height for non-treated wood to be above the ground. So if the telephone poles have at least an 8 inch diameter, we won't need treated joists and can use the decks as is (despite how challenging they are to move)."

,"Thanks for reaching out! I'm just curious how you're navigating the
liability portion of The 360 contract? We're excited about the opportunity
to be there but have concerns that 100% of the liability is on the artist,
specifically because we are not on-site and can't control or manage the
environment/participants. We tried to negotiate shared liability with the
org but they're not interested in making those changes. How are you guys
navigating this? Would love your feedback!
Thanks! :)","We really didn't give it a lot of thought. We figure it's a lot like
Burning Man in which there is an understanding that you take all the risks
coming to the event, and if someone falls off your piece, that's on them.
There's a possibility they could try to sue an artist for damages, but
would they win? Who knows?

As for possible damage to the piece, that's strangely common even in
establishment exhibition spaces. They don't typically insure pieces.

I know that isn't a lot of help."
,"Hello my lovely dusty friends, it was so lovely to see and squeeze you all, I miss you all so hard already ❤

If you have any (approved) camp related expenses, please be sure to send me those receipts. I would like to get everyone paid and the budget finalized as soon as possible. 

I don't need much from you, just a simple image of your receipt with a simple description of what the purchase was for. Please send this to me (if you hadn't already handed me our original to me while out on the playa)


Thank you in advance, I miss all you so incredibly much!

,"Hey you two,
Do you mind filling out the Crew Care Form just to test it?
Also, Rico, if you think Dill and I missed any important questions, please
let us know.
Once you both let me know it's okay, I could send it right away. Rico -
did you want me to wait until July 17, or can I just get this out?
Fill out the Crew Care Questionnaire here!","It looks great. Thank you for doing this so promptly. Here are some
suggestions:

   - For a longist form, I like to quickly tell what things I'm going to
   ask on page 1 in a quickie bulleted list so people don't put it aside to do
   later. And maybe tell them how long it will take to complete.
   - I want to stress that Crew Care is all about Care (not just food). Can
   we put the mission of Crew Care on page one or elaborate on the feelings
   page on ""Feelings count, too!"" Here's why: Our crew is kind of a bunch of
   crusty sons-of-bitches. And I think when we say, ""Now we talk about
   feelings..."" even Rico rolls his eyes. Rather we might say something like,
   ""Crew Care involves more than just feeding you and bringing you snacks. We
   want to make sure that the process is an enjoyable, rewarding one. That
   means knowing when to take a break, or when to sit down and rest, or
   knowing when you might want a kind word or touch..."" Tempting to just cut
   and paste what I wrote, but I suggest y'all make it your own.
   - You may want to organize it so food and allergy and wine details are
   the last rather than first.
   - I like that the ""When you're feeling drained"" question allows multiple
   selections
   - ""When I'm sad"" could be ""When I'm sad/upset/exhausted/fucked up"" and
   maybe it should be a long answer
   - ""Somebody should check in"" maybe should be a long answer. And maybe it
   should be broader than ""checking on me"" like I may need extra care.
   - ""Is there anything else"" probably should be a long answer.
   - How about a question like, ""Would you like us to share this with the
   rest of the crew care team so we can support each other?"" Maybe even an
   open long answer because there are some things people will want to share
   and other things not sso much.

Otherwise, this is really complete and awesome."

I am one of the drivers (pilots if you will) of the PV Monaco. We are a
scale replica of the USS Raleigh and the only tall ship to actually sail on
playa.
We are similarly stranded in time, somewhere between the golden age of
sail and 2023.
We take passengers around playa, through the night, to see art and on
voyages of the body and mind.
Email me- I’d love to supply a photo I’ve taken of our beautiful ship as
she sailed through a dust storm (yes the engine was in neutral, we can be
powered solely by the wind).
I was enchanted with your station last year, taking several trips out
there to unravel the mysteries, and I’d love for the Monaco to be featured
as per the post on Reddit.","I absolutely want to see the ship!

This sounds like a great match. Do you have any thoughts about how we can
drop hints about each other's projects?

Perhaps a simple cryptic note on the community board hints at goings on at
the French Quarter. Or maybe a letter in our post box. Or a postcard on a
bar that suggests visitors meet their love at Black Rock Station."

Hey, All, 
When's the last time your seashells went to the beach? Let's take them. Maybe they would like it! Friday at Twin Lakes State Beach. 

Aulinta means ""place of the red abalone"" so abalone shells are guests of honor, but any shells from anywhere can come. Driftwood, fossils, seaglass. Whatever you think might feel more cheersome if it got to go to the beach. 

We're hoping to have something like shish kebabs and s'mores after 4. If you think you're coming RSVP so we can better plan food, if you want food. 

You can take your shells back home. This is not suggesting you leave them on the beach, although you can if you like.

• How many meat eaters or vegans?
• Arrive 10/21 - at what time?

what we can provide on our end. It will be the same weekend as another
artwork is being installed, but we can work out the details.

us support you.

for a few more. Any chance there’ll be folks to help for short bursts of
some of the heavier stuff we have to lift, like the rails?","Here's what we will need at 360 in approximate order:

   1. *Friday, bobcat with frontloader: *Depending on the site, we may need
   some heavy equipment to help clear the site first thing. Site is roughly
   100' x 30'
   2. *Friday, VR with long forks: *Next we'll need to lift the structure
   and put it in place, as well as move heavier parts to site (ties, rails,
   and decks)
   3. At that point, we'll be leveling the structure and rebuilding the
   decks,,
   4. *Saturday, ditch witch:* a trencher speeds things up a good bit when
   putting in the ties
   5. *Saturday, 8"" and 12"" augers:* This will allow us to put in the
   crossing masts and put up the signal bridge.
   6. At that point, we'll erect the signal bridge A-frames and level them
   7. *Saturday, high lift:* This will allow us to lift the signal bridge
   in place
   8. After that, we have a whole lot of detail work"

So glad you are doing it again! So…

Short answer: YES! 

Longer answer: But it will need to wait until I find out for sure which day we are doing the BAAAHS takeover. 

Fuck, are we REALLY planning Black Rock City shit already? ","Yeah we are! We're doin it!

And this year we'll make arrangements ahead of time to keep the station supplied with weeklies. Last year, to my surprise, the paper box was cleaned out. And I think I heard that you even resupplied it. 

Being our second year, we can spent some energy taking care of details that alluded us last time. 

For instance, visitors tended to think the station was a puzzle box mystery. So we want to lean into that making allusions and ""clues"" that draw people to visit other long-running camps. Any ideas?"

planning trips for 3 people with varying vacation schedules and want to
make sure that we are able to fulfill all requirements of the station crew.
So, could you please send the *minimum* requirements for the team.
Must be on playa no later than (exact date), must remain on playa until at
least (exact date), and anything else we will be expected to
do/have/sing/etc.
I don't mean to be a bother, but I want to make sure that we can meet the
requirements and not be members that didn't do their part.
Love you.
","Helleleleleoooo Sam,

Sorry about the delay in answering.

I wanted to talk with other crew members to make sure we could address your
concerns. I hear you don't want to disappoint us by not pulling your
weight. So here's some ""minimum"" requirements you can weigh as you are
considering whether it will work for you and Pam:

We'd prefer if you were on playa by Wed Aug 23. We'd prefer if you could
break down at least one day Mon Sep 4. Pam is doing kitchen at Camp Blarg,
and so we thought rather than have her do Crew Care stuff which she might
be drawn to, for a change of pace, she could help with the interior or the
station, i.e., be a builder rather than support. You could also help us do
interior stuff, or instead, you could help set up and maintain camp which
the station crew relies on to live in creature comfort when we are not
building. During the event, crew often serve as station dispatchers, who
give people train tickets, answer questions, and generally be interactive.
We thought you'd love doing that. All of that is negotiable and we
understand that the health of everyone comes first.

As for your friend, we are running up against the limits of the free
tickets we have to distribute. If they are into serving as station crew and
willing to work, we could probably get some low-cost tickets and have the
project pay for that.

Is that too vague?"
,"so many emails!
sorry for the late reply.
a primer would be good. when i said ""they"" i meant that i didnt know the
borg would have an art piece back two years in a row.
would be interested in being a part of your crew, but i need details such
as: what are the dates that we HAVE to be on playa? what is the camping
situation? food? fees? csto? anything else you care to share?
","So...

The station crew is responsible for setting up the station and building all
the new things for it. We will arrive a week before the event on Aug 20th.
One of the first things we do is crack open the Camp Blarg container which we
have delivered early and set up the kitchen tent. The project covers your
food and feeds you during that build week. All of the camp crew are camping
with Camp Blarg, many of whom arrive a few days early to set up the rest of the
camp. The camp of course has their own camp fees which are still reasonable.

To be helpful on the crew, the latest I'd suggest you be there is late Tue
22 Aug.

What other questions can I answer, Sam?

Everyone (especially me) is so excited to see you. How is your health? I
want to see you, but of course I don't want to entice you into a situation
where you are miserable or endanger your health."
,"They are doing art two years in a row? That's awesome, I get to see it
now!
Just to throw a wrench into your plams, Pam! and I will be bringing a
friend with us this year.
","This is Blintz and my art piece. Who is ""they"" in your mind? Do you need a
catchup primer?

Well, we need a crew, Sam, to help make this thing come together again.
We have to put the station back together and build two new giant structures.

Responsibilities of being on the crew mean we show up a week early, we help
make this thing happen, put it together, etc.

Benefits of being on the crew are a free ticket and yummy food made for us
by our crew care team and a lovely patch of dirt to post up on.

We had some folks last year who were on the crew, but when they got there
were nowhere to be found when there was work to be done, so we wanna make
sure that anyone that is in, is really in."
,"what year is this?!?

I’ve gone down the rabbit hole trying to figure out why you chose 1931 and 1938. There was enough detail otherwise that I’m guessing the timeline isn’t random.

,"I am writing to you regarding the chestnut sample you sent.  Thank you for
your interest in our work and your willingness to submit this sample.
As for this particular sample, it appears to be a hybrid between European
chestnut and Chinese chestnut.  The European is the most similar to the
American chestnut and this sample had the glandular hairs (trichomes) that
resemble those of European.  Other features were more similar to Chinese,
which led me to suspect it was a hybrid.  There has often been
hybridization between the different chestnut species, so it isn’t greatly
uncommon to find them.

Hello,

I am a reporter for Artnet News and I am looking for photos of the art installations at this year's Burning Man gathering for an article I am working on. I will be publishing my story on September 2, so I would appreciate a timely response, if at all possible.

If you are able to provide images of your project in the Black Rock Desert, please send them at your earliest convenience. Also, if you would like to provide a quote, please feel free to answer any or all of the below questions. 

What was the inspiration for your Burning Man art installation? 

Is this your first time staging a Burning Man art project? If not, what Does it mean to have the event back after the pandemic-induced hiatus? 

What were your biggest challenges with this project, and how did you overcome them? 

What is the vibe at the gathering this year, and what is your favorite art piece besides your own?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you. 

All the best,","Our project was Black Rock Station, a classic rural train station that has come unstuck in time, haunted by ghost trains heard but not seen. 

This was a Burning Man honoraria project three years in the making from artists Wes Modes and SL Benz, who’re responsible for another honoraria project in 2018. 

It was inspired by our love of Northern Nevada’s railroad history and the beauty of the vast Black Rock Desert, as well as our love of world building art. 

The biggest challenge was bringing 120 feet of real rail to the desert and installing it by hand with our humble but had working crew of 15. 

We are a crew of artists with our roots at Burning Man going back nearly 30 years, with 24 years working on the long-running Camp Blarg Soulmate Trading Outlet theme camp. 

Photos to follow."

Glad you like them! They’re all in there now. I took a guess on Paging Announcement 1 that the Doctor’s name was a Spanish one, to be pronounced Ana Mariela Zevallos. I wish I could have heard how my colleagues through the years pronounced it!","Woot woot. Now I have to update the announcement programming!

Thanks again, B."
,"Ok, I’ll have a go at it. Btw there’s a few samples my general human-size
approach to 2110 announcements in our shared Black Rock station folder.
Only got through a few before this work myg, but there’s still time to
offer voicing notes before I get back to it — will happily redo if it’s
different from what you had in mind.","These are amazing! B, so good."
,"
I’d be honored — i saw there were a couple names w/o corresponding psas. I was rooting for them to come in on time. 

I’m glad for the name changes for the frequent set— I sort of wondered about that, comparing the original text to your 2110 descriptor. And I wonder if I can hear those two ‘especially’ native names. Do we know which tribe/language? 

I’ll need to do these tomorrow, or I just won’t be able to get to them till the weekend, and I would think that’s cutting it too close. So: you should have it all in hand by Thursday morn!","’s my annotated text:

Good evening! May I have your attention please. Western Pacific regional train, the Pacific Zephyr, with a 7:48 PM departure destination Chicago, calling at: Winnemucca, Elko, Wells, Salt Lake City GBW, Provo, Seeds-kee-dee-Agie (pronounced Seeds-kee-dee-Agie in Shoshone), Grand Junction, Granby, Niinenii-Niicie (pronounced: Nee-nĕ-nee Nee-chĭĕ in Arapaho), Lincoln, Omaha, Mt. Pleasant, Burlington, Princeton, and Chicago GLR. Please be sure you have all your personal belongings with you, and thank you for riding Western Pacific.

So Shoshone and Arapaho. There are a few good sources for pronunciation in Arapahoe, but didn’t see much for Shoshone."
,"If that seems too crazy or if mispronunciation seems like a dishonor to
the native languages, just go with the anglo names.
Your facility for languages never fails to impress me.","Two late breaking survey respondents. Last ones I will accept. But if you
find it in the kindness of your heart to do two more, here they are. If
not, please let me know and I will do it.

Erik Nelson Charlie, please report to candy mountain. Charlie to Candy
Mountain.
Even West Passengers Luna JunIper and Stella Willow please see the station
agent.

I appreciate your offer of help. It really did take a load off."
,"On it. Anything else about the friendly human-sized solarpunk future &
vibe?","I see your Clean Language there! It is much more multicultural than our
U.S. society now and that's why there is Spanish and Chinese translations.

Here are my meta notes that helped us write the researcher's journal found
in the station. Important Events, Regions, and Area Place-Names


   -

   Post-collapse 2110 is a hopeful solarpunk future where smaller
   communities are exploring post-capitalist alternatives and human-scale
   projects
   -

   The Collapse was about 2055 to 2065, a pretty bad decade for everyone,
   worldwide
   -

   The US was reorganized according to watershed bio-regions
   -

   Everything is, for the most part, hyper-locally focused
   -

   Old pre-collapse political divisions have little meaning in 2110
   -

   People would be more likely to tell you what desert, what mountain, what
   river, or what coastal area they are from
   -

   Many places have lost their settler-colonial names in favor of ingenious
   names
   -

   Pacific Basin Watershed Bio-Region (PBR) includes what was coastal
   California
   -

   Great Basin Watershed Zone (GBW) includes former Nevada and parts of Utah
   -

   Historic names for towns and cities are still used unless they have been
   replaced by indiginous names


Does that help get a view of the place/time?"
,"Wes, I would love to. I could get to them Wednesday at the
earliest and latest, then things get super busy. Gimme whatchoo got!
Bonnie","Okay! Thanks, B.

Would you rather do 2014 or the beautiful friendly solarpunk future 2110
recordings (which will also have a Spanish and Chinese versions)?"
,"OK! All done, in their original .m4a format, trimmed. I wish I had that satisfying ""pa system clicking on/off"" sound for a header & footer to each one, but alas!","Oh my God these are so good.

You left me wanting more.

Would you be willing to do a few more announcements that will serve as the more frequent station announcements for one of the 8 eras through which the station slips?"
,"﻿
Dang this sounds like a juicy, immersive project. Well done/doing, sir!","Thanks, B. I saw the recordings tumbling in. To me is fine. I’ll be placing them in the system."
,"Fun! Of course its just me and my iPhone these days, no special microphone. But I am happy to reduce some of your load!

And also: Hey I can cast a synthesized voice on Play.ht record some, for that 2110 feel? ","2014 is the only one that has synthesized voices and it is already full.  so let’s just make them all warm and human. Thanks, B. 

2110 is a world that is very human sized and organic focused. 2066 has no announcements and the station is almost quiescent with occasional pirate video and audio coming over the airwaves."
,"That is how I will do it, then! 

Forgive my delay, had a chesty cold that messed with my psa pipes for weeks. Weeks!

current process for fixes and let you know.
Thank you and happy Monday!
Krista / Valkyrie","Any word? Parch keeps pimping the AltSpaceVR worlds and talking about tours
they plan to give and how we can show our crew around. But ours is still in
the incomplete state we left it in during Desert Arts Preview. I know you
all are volunteers or overworked peeps with other jobs, but I'd like to set
the expectations of my excited crew."
,"Update is we are moving ahead and working to get an earlier version of
Black Rock Station model back into one of the worlds.
Thank you for your understanding and your kind words 💖","That's kinda too bad. It looked better than I expected, but also kinda
broken.

Guess it is officially better than nothing!"
,"Yes, it was there. I saw it too. It is a really great piece!! Even with some of the file converting issues it's still fun to see in 3D. 

The team of modelers split up the submitted projects in order to work on all the necessary repairs. As they worked through their lists, the worlds have been updated with changes. This is why the model for Black Rock Station is not in the same world now.

As you can imagine, our small volunteer team has been working extremely long hours this past week - (neglecting their day jobs, their family time, their own birthday, and one is working even with a COVID infection) Yesterday, the modeler that has been working on the model for Black Rock Station did respond to our team chat or emails.

We're really hoping it's ready and he'll send it this morning. If we don't hear from him, we may have to go with an earlier version. 

Thank you for following up. I will let you know when I know more. Of course, still feel free to send me questions and I will keep trying to find out the status.","I took a look at all four of the available worlds and appreciated all the detailed textures, functional staircases, Lighting effects, and animations that had been applied. As an amateur 3-D modeler, I can definitely appreciate the amount of work that is clearly going into this. All of these works are so much more detailed than what we’ve seen in BRCvr in previous years. Good work everyone!"
,"﻿
No response yet from the modeler that was working on that one. I'll try again in the morning 🤞🤞","Thanks. It previewed in the second Desert arts preview area, but was gone last time I checked."

some observations.

   - The places where there are missing textures/surfaces shouldn't be
   there. Those are probably whatever color is nearby.
   - Doors should be the colonial yellow with brown panels
   - The other missing textures are provided in the zip I just uploaded
   - I also included a note called TEXTURE NOTES.txt included in the zip
   that tells where all the missing textures go
   - The poster might be hard to place, but the objects may well still be
   there.
   - I'll also include some reference photos that will help
   - Would you rather rotate the doors open so that people can walk through
   in VR, or just turn off collisions?

I made it a missed connections kind of story between Alex and Ollie. So
your suitcase will have the letter attached to it from Ollie to strangers
finding it, saying take all belongings.
We will bring the letter to affix to the suitcase...and restock the
suitcase daily.
And your letters from Alex saying they will be waiting in the train
station (with the rest of your copy) will be put into Kostume Kult pockets

Stefan and I would also be happy to act out and Alex and Ollie moment in
the station when we come by, to activate it. See attached pdf.","So to summarize:

The station will have an abandoned suitcase full of costume bits to rifle
thru and take, with a letter something like ""My true love left me for
another at this station. Please take his clothes and wear them as your own.
I can no longer bear to look at them. I left all his belongings with
Kostume Kult to disperse freely. Go there for more. Goodbye forever Henry.""

waiting in the train station will be put into Kostume Kult pockets of the
offerings. You are printing a bunch.

I'm looking forward to working and playing with y'all. Any other ways we
can complicate things?

We'd love to have y'all at the Black Rock Station 85th Anniversary
Celebration and Rededication 10am to noon, August 28th. Champagne will be
served. If you have a moment to visit, during build week we'll be working
at the station from sunup until dinner. After that, we'll be kicking it at
the Camp Blarg burn barrel (Rods Road @ 4:00)."

even put a label on the handle with a note as you mentioned. What is your
address?

,"I wanted to send a final update and a big thank you for the support you gave in order for me to get my paramedic license.

I got the final state and federal license last week so the journey took about 14 months. Not a record but pretty darn fast. 

I'm already responding to calls in my area with the fire department and will start full time on a year contract with AMR, the company that serves southern Oregon and remote parts of northern California.

I've also taken the medic skills and designed a course that is already being taught to folks going out to Ukraine to provide emergency medical services to civilians in active conflict zones.

So from the bottom of my heart I once again say thank you. Stay safe, be well, and hug those you love.","Yay, Matt! You’re doing great!!"

of Sept. 1.

station?

has been volunteered as 'tiger bait'. He is vexed, but faithful.","Okay, I have you down for those dates.

The station is currently at Burning Man 360 near Gerlack. A crew would have
to go there early to disassemble most of what can't be easily transported.
Then it gets moved to the Playa and we reassemble it.

No doubt, there will be some repairs. This year we are adding a sizable
water tower and a sizable billboard near the station. We also have some
substantial ephemera additions to deep in the mystery of the station as
well.

I'm sorry Lord Cameron will not be in attendance this year. With the new
territories granted him in the New World by the king and the untold
prophets of the triangle trade, I'm sure he has his hands full.

how to do that. I'll get something off to you this week.Are there 
guidelines, other than the date range? Size, material, level of snark? ",Always nice to see stuff that fits in well with a Station drifting between 1855 and 2110.
,"Howdy Wes,
I wanted to ask you about something you mentioned in passing last year.
The subject was Art team vs CAMP BLARG camper responsibilities and how to
manage one's time.
As a camper of CAMP BLARG as well as being on the art team (and being the
greenest newbie EVER) last year I was faced with a most powerful conundrum.
I'm a people-pleaser and I found trying to be loyal to two nations
challenging. I also think I was overthinking it sometimes.
I was worried that I broke a covenant with CAMP BLARG by leaving early,
forgetting when my cooking days were, and not pitching in much setting up
camp and tearing down. I also didn't really have my sea-legs when attending
to the BRS.
I want to be a part of this again this year. Be honest. Am I being too
self-conscious? Was my personal schedule last year a problem for anyone? Do
I monologue (I know you hate monologuers [not even a real word])?
Your answer is going to be short, isn't it. Something like, ""dude, don't
worry! ""
Regards","Juju!

Sorry about the delayed response. I got distracted by knee surgery and the
start of classes.

Yes! Sounds like you had a change of heart? Does your sweetheart want to
kick you out of the house for a few weeks in August?

What are your current thoughts? Do you want to be part of the Station crew
again this year?  We'd love to have you. Do you want to be part of Camp Blarg?
We'd love to have you. Lemme know what you want and we'll see what we can
do.

Yes, yes, we'd LOVE to have you back.

If you are part of the station crew, I have a ticket for you."
,"That's an excellent question that only brody can answer. This whole tic
keting system is ridiculously complicated.
on another note: you got the additional waps I presume?","Yes! We did! Thank you. It took a while to figure out what the fuck it was.
Lol.

I'm having everyone confirm they got everything they expected. Should I
contact Brady directly or go through you?"
,"That's sounds amazing!!! I will absolutely make wonderful things happen! 😊
I will have two envelopes with me in my truck, one for Camp Blarg receipts and one for BRS receipts!!
    Most stuff won't be any issue for us doing meals and clean up.... We will definitely have time to help when we'd like on building! With only have as many people or less, it really isn't hard work, plus just having Button and Wednesday, we'll have things done in no time flat. 
   I realized I forgot to add coffee! I am gonna order the coffee you mentioned, for both BRS and CAMP BLARG. Gotta do orders by tomorrow. 

My Venmo is @Stacey-OFlynn
That honestly helps me out a ton!! I will save every receipt! 

(((((HUGZ))))) I'm super excited!! Can't wait to hug everyone! (With consent😄)","Dill, do you nurse another cash app? I’m having some stupid trouble with Venmo. 

Google Pay? Cash App? PayPal?"
,"I have a 3 burner stove in my camper if all else fails. 😏 My main concern
to get the kitchen up and running is actually the freezer , secondly the
frig.  Anything else I can work with 😏
I could definitely deal with a larger budget, which would help with
snacks, desserts, first aid stuff and more! I'd like to get the
electrolytes ordered, I have the 3 cases for Camp Blarg now but I'm not sure
that would last for 2 weeks. I think at least one or two cases would do for
the first week.
If I had a budget of $1500, there would absolutely be wine with every
dinner! 😄
I also can figure some wonderful snacks, desserts, and the midnight grill
cheese would be pretty amazing!
Let's me see if I can work on the add ONS and come up with something to
show you!
 Regarding the surprise dinner ... I believe we decided on Wednesday....
That's when you felt the building would be fully erected? That's the
lasagna dinner ...
I've been collecting things to make this super special! String lights,
white table clothes, curtain shears, .... I'm looking at buying those big
white chef hats for Barton, Welsy and I to serve, some candles, maybe
some fake flowers. The real nice paper china and napkins ... Plastic wine
glasses, I'm looking into music.... I've got an idea on how to set up a
real special little area....
We'll put it up a short walk away from the station so people don't see it
all coming together so closely, and I'm planning to have it so the space is
facing the sunset over the mountains. I'm hoping to create a pretty magical
feeling!
Ok..... I'll get on this tomorrow and get it done by this weekend!!! ♥️","I am working with Camp Blarg management to try to get the container placed
early so that wwe can start working on infrastructure, including the
kitchen as soon as we hit playa.

Gimme your venmo account and I will send you $1500 bucks. That way you
don't have to front the costs. Return whatever you don't use at the end of
the event. Very important to save all receipts for me.

Red wine is pref for Blintz and I. We are not too proud to drink Two-Buck
Chuck from TJs.

We have a first aid kit for the station build site, so don't worry about
that. And I think I mentioned that I got TWO 5-gallon water containers for
the build site.

Your plans for the surprise on-site dinner sound magical. I can't wait!"
,It would help if I added the damn attachments .....duh.....🙄,"Finally, got a chance (and remembered) to look at this.  Of course, it is
brilliant.

My only concern is breakfast on day two. I don't think it needs to be
changed, but we might plan for contingencies.  If for some reason, we don't
get the kitchen put together on Day One (Mon), I want to make sure people
can still start Day Two full of bacon, eggs, potatoes, and hashbrowns.

So perhaps that means we prioritize on Day One excavating the stoves and
kitchen wares and maybe cooking in the open air. What happens if it is
windy? Well, don't know. But we should probably give that a think.

The costs are amazingly economical. For instance, on Wednesday the total
cost is 72 bucks to feed 11 people. Total cost for all means is $515.

I know there are still things not on this menu list, like electrolytes,
special desserts, basic first aid, late night grilled cheese, etc.  Do you
have a sense how much the grand total would add up to for the station
budget?

What would you do if I increased your total crew-care budget to $1000? What
about $1500? What would that change? Would you want to include wine with
dinner?

And finally, what day did you decide was the day we eat AT the station?"
,Thanks. Done.,Now I no longer have a ticket to the burning man. 😢

,"We're having bigger conversation about this as several larger art pieces are impacted, but for right now, I would not speculate on getting physical tickets. I am sorry for this. This is a new thing and in my own opinion absolute crap. But, things are hard to change in the org when the process started.

Let me see what I can do about WAPs","I know this doesn't solve your bigger problem, but we have been trading crew and Camp Blarg people for physical tickets so that the handful of people we need to get in before noon on the 22nd can get in and start interacting with artery. so while that is not completely dialed in, we do have a solution we are working on for our team.

However. We still have two important crewmembers who don’t have WAPs for the 22nd. Anything you can do there?"

will be interested. I'm glad the board has been talking about that. We are
open to the museum acquiring the station after next year's event. I'd love

It will be played truly randomly. It will be one paging announcement for one of the trains on one of the years that the station happens to drift to. So completely unpredictable.

   I wish we had chatted earlier, we just wrapped up the passport.  We
included a puzzle in the passport this year, with a challenge to decode 12
camp names.  I would've loved to have hidden some more puzzles in the
passport and had a tie in with the Black Rock Station.
   We managed to squeeze Black Rock Station in :)     Nothing comes to
mind at the moment for a way to collaborate more than having a stamp at the
Station.  However, once the passport actually goes to printers today or
tomorrow, I'll have a little more time to think about it.  If anything
comes to mind for you, please let me know.
   We are looking at creating some more intricate puzzles for 2024.
Ideally involving 6-12 camps and art pieces, with a theme or story that is
shared across the individual puzzles. But the puzzles would leverage the
interactivity of the camps and art pieces.  And then the solutions to those
puzzles form a meta puzzle to be solved.  Perhaps that's something you'd be
interested in for next year?
Thanks for reaching out, and I hope we find something this year *and* next
year :)","We have a stamp coming! Thanks for including us last minute in the listing.
We filled out the form earlier, but perhaps it was lost in the mail.

One scheme we've concocted with Kostume Kult is to have a leather
period-appropriate suitcase full of clothes at the station with a note that
suggests people should wear these clothes of a lost lover or find more at
Kostume Kult. I suggested they slip love letters into the pockets of other
clothing they are giving away that direct people to the station.

We have postal boxes that people love to open. Perhaps you could provide a
few envelopes addresses to fictional BRC addressees where you've ""mailed""
them their passport with instructions. Another way for people to receive a
passport?"

,"Thanks so much for reaching out and taking time to put together this email. I'm relatively new to the Grants Program - I started in this role in March after working with the Humanities Institute in a different capacity for about a year prior. The Grants Program is also undergoing changes at many different levels, as we work to improve systems and make things more equitable. While I'm very sorry to hear about your poor experience, this feedback is timely and very helpful. I will share your email (anonymously) with our Grants Committee during our next meeting. I'm writing responses below, but also would be very happy to meet with you briefly and have a conversation about your experience. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in!

Some background about our 2022 review process - 

In our spring cycle this year (which was already open when I began in my role), we had our Grants Committee, composed of majority BIPOC community volunteers, act as our review panel - reading and scoring applications. Still, I noticed some inconsistencies in scoring, similar to what you described. The Grants Committee and I met to draft funding recommendations for the BOD, but in a two-hour meeting, I found we did not have time to discuss everything that I wanted to.

So, for our fall cycle (applications just closed 9/28) - the Grants Committee and I decided to try something different. I am reviewing and scoring all applications (145), with some limited support from other staff members for conflicts of interest. I am preparing a synopsis of each application, including excerpts and samples, for the Grants Committee. The Grants Committee will be having a much longer, more in-depth opportunity to review the materials and make funding recommendations (two 4-hour meetings instead of one 2-hour meeting).

There are a few reasons we made this change. First, this method retains a community-centric approach, and also will allow for a more complete analysis of all applications. We think this may prove to be more valuable than having community panelists, especially at this critical point where equity is our #1 priority and things are in flux. Second, the time to coordinate a volunteer panel has been huge and a big drain on our staff capacity. 

It sounds like, maybe, this change will help avoid some of the concerns you shared (and the similar inconsistencies I noticed this spring). I don't know yet whether this strategy will be short-term or long-term, and it'll be interesting to evaluate it after this cycle. 

All that being said, our grants have become very competitive due to budget constraints and increasing number of requests. This cycle, we will only be funding about 36% of the total $ requested. As part of our equity work, we take into consideration applicant and project demographics in addition to scores, to ensure we are funding a diverse group of grantees. 

Phew, this was a long email! Please do share any thoughts/reactions you may have after reading, and/or your availability to meet in person or by Zoom. I'm out of town and on Eastern Time until this upcoming Wednesday 10/19.

Thanks again for your honest feedback!","What a thoughtful email. I am so grateful that you spent the time to share this with me. I love to hear the things you are working through. I support the councils equity work and am happy to contribute however I can to make the process fair, equitable, and consistent. 

I would love to meet with you. I have an art installation (https://blackrocktrainstation.com/) over the next week and a half. Perhaps after Oct 24th?"

Can you please mail it to me? ","I think he will pick it up at Wilco, though I’m not 100% certain quite yet."
,"I'm going to do  my best to explain our plan with words. Let me know what
you think and if I need to make it more clear.
We've decided we cannot risk taking the hyster off-road so we are going to
use slings to carry the structure to the installation site. Two long slings
will basket-carry the building around short-way.
We will need to remove the section of roofing adjacent to the
already-removed section. We will add two wood supports across the short
span of these open sections (probably sistered 2x6s) that will fasten to
the top of the walls. This will keep the walls from being squeezed by the
slings when it's lifted. We will also screw four chunks of blocking to the
outside of the structure to keep them ~8' apart to balance out the weight
on the slings.
We will test this out to make sure that it will work without damaging the
building. Our super pro-rigger/structural engineer/heavy equipment operator
will be doing the lift so know that our best people are on it :)
How do you feel about this? Give me the go-ahead and we will keep you
posted on all the progress.
Thanks!","Checking with Jan our chief builder feller. He'll offer any suggestions or
concerns as soon as he reads through your email tonight.

Here are some things you need to know.

*How do you remove the two opposing roof panels?*

   1. There are something like 6 to 8 T-25 screws holding each roof panel
   in three places. I suggest this order:
      1. There are likely screws in the rafters holding them together, They
      can be removed from the inside.
      2. There are screws UP from the ridge beam system INTO each panel.
      You can remove those from below the ridge beam.
      3. There are screws holding the Simpson hurricane ties to the
      rafters, you need only remove the ones in the rafters, and leave the ties
      which go beneath the paneling.
   2. There may be some wiring staples fastening wires to the panel. Remove
   these gingerly with a screwdriver, but you can leave them up there.
   3. At that point, the panel should be free and it can be lifted over the
   Simpson hardware. If it Doesn't feel loose, you probably missed one or more
   screws.

*How should it be oriented?*

   1. As we talked about, the side with three windows (door to the right)
   is the front and should face the road.
   2. Do your best to orient it so it is perpendicular to the line of the
   road.
   3. You already know from the flags where it goes.

*Anything else?*

   1. If you place it on some RR ties, it will be easy for us to lift and
   place on its new foundation.
   2. I'd appreciate if you document it with some short video of prep,
   lift, travel, and placement. Cellphone video in horizontal orientation
   would be great for our doc we will gett around to making.

Okay, waiting for the thumbs up or down from Jan."

,"Sorry for the super slow reply! Answers in line below:

I haven't used the F6, and the manual I'm finding is not helping me out a lot here on what the 0, -6, and -12 settings actually are. I'm guessing they're pads to add extra headroom for very loud sources. If so, might not hurt to engage to add a little extra safety. But if the knob was at 60%, then I'd start with lowering there instead. Those pads are usually for when something's still coming in hot even with the levels turned way down.

Overall, setting levels is really always relative to the source. This is a tricky situation for that since you can't ask the train to do a couple test passes to set levels. It may take a little trial and error. Overall, though, quieter is better than louder for the recording. If the gear distorts, there's only so much I can do to remove the sound of that - but I can turn things up. The tradeoff there is just that the other sounds come up, too, but I don't think that's much of a concern in our case. With, say, a super quiet instrument you wind up bringing up electronics noise you don't want, but that's not our situation.

Do make sure the limiter is not on - same for the high pass filter (HPF).
Yeah, stereo and identical. Skimming the manual, I think the LR track is a sum of all inputs that you can enable or disable. So, that makes sense in this case that it would be identical with just the two mics coming in. It'll take up extra space, of course, so might be worth switching off - looks like it's in the REC settings. 
Cool - I'll build something around that existing recording, though if the VTA electric light rail is a potential target, the library may have us covered (pending approach and departure, of course). I'll give the VTA a listen and work on that tonight, though fully prepared for the original recording to be the preference. 
Will do - sorry not to have been on top of that!

And, just to confirm, at this point, I'm not attempting a patched together version from the libraries for anything but the future train, right?","Yup, patched together from libraries just the future train and still the VTA may have us covered. The VTA on YouTube sounds great so I will try a recording there.

There Will still be several things to patch together from field recordings. For instance a steam locomotive + freight cars is just not a thing that exists any longer. So we can take a steam locomotive recording and splice that with a recording of just freight train cars passing. 

I should have some more recordings for you after this coming week."
,"Hope stuff at UCSC finished up smoothly. Combining replies to this email and the test recordings email:

Was that Scott loaning the gear? We've worked together a little.

48k/32-bit is no problem. Pretty much every contemporary DAW operates at 32-bit floating point internally. I think 48k is fine. Lots of libraries will record at 96k, but a good chunk of the rationale for that is letting folks do things like drop the speed and still have good fidelity, which we don't need to worry about.

Dynamics-wise, these did get hot, but the advantage of 32-bit floating point is that it really can't clip, as you mention (the theoretical dynamics range there is something like 1500 dB!). However, that's not to say preamps and even the mic diaphragm itself can't get overloaded, though. So, do still try to set levels with the mics to avoid analog distortion even though you're clear digitally. I don't feel like these sound distorted much - but it is audible in the loudest parts of the 011 files a bit. Sometimes a little distortion is actually helpful to convey the impression of loudness, but it'd be nice to able to introduce that intentionally as choice rather than baking it in, of course.

They do both have a couple unwanted sounds (car horn from it being locked, I'd bet, in the tail of 011, for instance, along with voices as it's fading off). It's not impossible to clean discrete sounds out, but every step risks leaving artifacts - and anything more continuous would be tricky. That, I'm sure, is going to be the big challenge of getting these yourself - just impossible to control what's going on around the site, right?

Was there meant to be a difference between the 1_2.wav and the L_R.wav versions? Those sound identical - and the numbers on their levels are identical, too. If you were intending to, say, record the internal Zoom mics and the 414, I think you got two copies of one option instead. There's some settings tweaking in the Zoom to get the external and internal mics simultaneously. I had to do that on the H4ns we used before.

One hanging question from my last email: For the future trains, how close are the ""modern"" train recordings I dropped in the shared folder last time to what you're imagining? If they're not too close, any movies or shows with futuristic sounding trains that would be a good reference to aim for?

Do let me know here if you want me to try out some Frankensteining from the Boom library before you go too far into doing your own recordings. I know recording trips are going to be a ton of time, and I can mock up a couple of these relatively quickly. If I can get at least some of them up to the standard of realism you want, I imagine I could save you some trips, right?

Timing-wise, I've got a film project to work on that's most pressing right now. So, no need for ASAP once you're back. I'm hoping to wrap that film up by the end of the month. On the other end, I've got to travel for a memorial in August right before the semester, and, of course, I'd love to have most of August clear for prep. So, I guess that makes July prime time for this. I've got a relatively short anniversary trip in the middle, but otherwise, I'm around and not committed beyond a couple recording sessions and Kali's monthly radio show.",You sent this at 2 AM? Do you sleep?
,"<https://wenzyco.slack.com/team/U023ASNAR34> would be able to draw our
needed recordings from sound libraries, but after listening, I suspected
they were inadequate as foreground sound at realistic volumes with no other
mixed-in sound. With no visual train, visitors will be hyper-focused on the
audio and will readily notice unrealistic edits and splices. Even to the
degree that shortcuts won't be noticed consciously, I think they will be
picked up at some level at the cost of world-building immersion (my
philosophy for the greater project). SO... it turns out I have a friend who
was able to loan me a matched pair of really really expensive mics and a
kickass high-end recorder to do some field recording. Working with @Nathan
M Goodman <https://wenzyco.slack.com/team/U01TR6V37EY>, we brainstormed
very feasible locations to do recordings. So with great borrowed equipment,
I can go solo all over the state to create the recordings we need, and
Larnie can engineer these as needed.","Sorry for my radio silence. Mostly I was finishing up my UCSC quarter.

After our discussion about the libraries, I think they may be helpful for
some of the fringe stuff, but for the bread and butter items, I think we'll
have to rely on fieldwork. But that's where there is really good news.

So here is the update I just dropped in the project Slack:

*Train Recording: *Big changes here. I was hoping @Larnie"
,"Hey Wes,
I'm rolling now on going through the Boom library. Take a look at notes on
the sound sheet, and I've identified some candidates, uploaded those to a
shared Drive folder, and left notes including some questions. I'm
optimistic we can get almost all of it out of what's in the library.
I can keep looking at the diesel options (lots in the library) for those,
and let me give you a little time otherwise to respond to those questions I
added.
Separately, do you want to do the announcement recordings in the studio at
CSUMB? If we can get folks who'd be reading down, we can get really high
quality capture. Otherwise, I could come up with good mics and my interface
if there's a very quiet spot available to get them cleanly.","Thanks for going through these. I listened to all the ones you put in the
google drive. I found a few that I thought had possibility, but many were
missing some critical sonic aspects. Here's what I observed:

   - All of them had clean isolated sound
   - They were all recorded with good mics with good windscreens, seemingly
   - Nearly all of them were faded in and faded out and it didn't sound
   quite natural. A passing train can be heard several minutes before it
   arrives and for several minutes after it passes, so any recording less than
   about 3 minutes is incomplete.
   - Some of them (like the first one) were recorded from a moving train
   and didn't seem to have the stereo dynamics of a passing train.
   - All of the departure recordings started when the train departs, but do
   not include the train idling and puffing burst of steam, not to mention the
   arrival.
   - Some of the passing trains were just locomotives with no cars, and so
   were missing the dynamics of the trailing cars.

Now possibly all of these things can be mitigated by combing this and other
archives, combining recordings, and clever engineering. The danger, for me,
has always been, that nothing sounds quite as authentic as an authentic
recording. Since I've spent so much time standing right next to passing
trains, I hear immediately these missing elements. Most people would not,
of course, but attention to authenticity is always a subconscious immersive
effect.

Someone was considering volunteering to record some train sounds, but I
don't think he quite knew what he was getting into. Here what I told him
were the criteria I was looking for:

   - Matched pair of balanced Omni or cardioid large diaphragm
   condenser mics
   - Digitally recorded at 44.1khz, 24-bit. We used zoom H4s with the XLR
   connectors
   - Mics with good windscreens spaced 8m apart on tripods, 6m from the
   tracks.
   - Mics pointed forward perpendicular to the tracks
   - Recording sensitivity at about 60% to prevent clipping, but you may
   have to do an experiment or two and watch the recording level
   - Pick a location where there is no extraneous sound except the train
   and the tracks. We don’t want things like crossing bells or announcements.
   - We need discrete recordings of each train arriving, passing, and then
   departing. The recording starts just before the train can be heard, and
   ends just after the train can no longer be heard.
   - Our list of trains includes a variety of trains, but all with full
   trains of passenger or freight cars, some passing fast, some passing
   slowly, and some stopping briefly in front of the mics,

There are some trains, like the future train, that are impractical
to record. These may be a good choice for assembling from parts.

I have the time and the inclination to jet around and make recordings in
various places with various pieces of equipment. As long as I have a couple
tripods, mics, and Zooms. However, I lack decent microphones. That is why I
was considering pricing some decent large diaphragm mics that would be
lower end than what we were using, but adequate. Your suggestions are
welcome.

What do you think?

As for the announcement, happily, I've recorded most of these. They can be
super low-fi since they are coming out of the shittiest speaker horn and
should preferably be garbled and semi-unintelligible."
,"I hope you are doing well. I would like to give you a call to discuss everything , just wanted to make sure we are on the same page regarding expenses. Let me know when would be a good time for me to give you a call.","Good to hear from you. I hope you and your family are doing great.

Tomorrow would be just fine. I sometimes missed calls but if you leave a message I will call you right back.

,"I've attached pictures if the pendent. 
It wllhave a golden spike and filed with Playa.",Wow! That is so cool and on point!
,"I just wanted to say, that's almost certainly Brady's not my work",You both are killing it. We’re a good team. 
,"So as I mentioned, we have one crew member with a missing ticket.
Everything else appears okay.
The crew member is Jillian Davies","Whatever you did, your kick unclogged the mysterious Ticket Machine, and my
crewmember received their ticket in their will call box.

Thanks to your and Brady."
,"That would be perfect

I can whip up a document that includes what plans we have and our
engineering/architectural notes if it is helpful.","Here you go! I'm excited about this.

Let me know if there is anything else you need. Or if you are pitching this
idea to others in the Org, lemme know if there are any changes it would be
helpful to make."
,Do you have a full document of engineer drawings?,I can whip up a document that includes what plans we have and our engineering/architectural notes if it is helpful.

Here’s that pdf."
,"I understand, what ever would show some of the detail.
I really love your art.","Okay, you asked for it!

The first bunch of stuff is renderings or manipulated images of the station."
,"By chance if you have any updated imagery, would love to see it.
Looking forward to our conversation",A lot of everything is just unimpressive disassembled random bits. What kind of photos would you like? We have everything from detailed renderings to lots of parts in progress.
,"Excellent, Friday works for me, let say 10:30 ish if that works for you, talking primarily about installing artwork @ 360’. I can send a link, to who ever you want on the zoom call",That’s perfect. Let’s say a link to both Blintz and I will be great.
,"First I must thank you & your crew for your creativity and I can imagine that you & your crew are beyond busy right now getting ready to finish up & install in Black Rock City.
When you submitted your proposal for art in Black Rock City back in 2020, you stated you wanted the artwork “Black Rock Station” for off-playa placement. Are you still interested in doing this?

In your space time, if you are interested, read the information below, because we would love to talk about a lease opportunity for “Black Rock Station”. Thank you.


Burning Man in Gerlach ~ Opportunities & Background 

In the absence of Black Rock City over the last two years, we (Burning Man) have been focusing our energies on growing our overall impact through the expansion and development of our properties in Gerlach. 

The Burning Man Project’s new properties place radical inclusion and communal effort at the forefront of development. Working alongside the local community, we are utilizing real estate to expand economic growth in Gerlach by building an ongoing rural community center which will help support the local economy during the “other 51 weeks” in the desert. The Gerlach commercial core includes land holdings such as the historic 1920’s Desert Club Hotel, believed to be the first building in Gerlach, various commercial and residential properties, as well as an RV park. We have also agreed to partner with the University of Nevada, Washoe County and the Nevada State Small Business Development Center to host a business incubator at the Desert Club to guide and encourage small enterprises.

The 360: Located about a mile east of Gerlach along highway 34 

In the summer of 2021, we started building the 360 site: an ongoing maker space that will function as a local storage and studio facility, eliminating the many miles expended through the transportation of art, storage containers, and building materials from external locations to Gerlach and Black Rock City. The 360 Village will contain a solar-powered campground, art studios/shops, housing for residents and visitors, and classrooms. Other features include:
A 100-acre destination sculpture park
Healing Russian banya and hot springs 
A platform to host sustainability gatherings 
Mechanical facilities to support art car and theme camp builds
An expansion of storage options

This property will support Black Rock City by bringing the things that make the city what it is closer to the event site, lessening our carbon footprint substantially. Finally, we will be building a large facility to host the Gerlach Workforce Development Center.  Our goal for this program is to leverage the incredible knowledge and experience inside the Burning Man community to teach valuable skills and develop accredited courses in Gerlach, while also building a dynamic workforce for Burning Man Project, Gerlach, and the Northern Nevada region. The 360 will act as a hub for sustainable practices, artistic talent, diverse education, and vibrant community relations, providing a year-round foothold into Burning Man culture for veterans and newcomers alike.",Yes! Let’s talk soon. Does Wed or Fri morning between 9am and noon work for you? Zoom link?
,"I'm down for that. 

Are paper tickets not checked against names they were sent to? Though don't know why I'm asking that - how would I know, I haven't been for years, and I'm sure that would have been one of the first things you considered.",I think tickets are freeeeeeeeee in the world
,"Hi, sorry didn’t get to look through it all, had a busy day/evening with our Board. What I did see and read looked great, though.",Wooo
,"My wife Donna asked me to reply to your email. Farmer's Crossing is one spot that could work for sound recording, as well as Estates Crossing.  Another spot is at the east end of the Farwell Bridge.  There is a half mole up hill grade just west of the bridge.  The locomotive will be working hard.  This is a popular spot for photos.  

You can also park at our Fremont Station entrance at 37029 Mission Boulevard, at the corner of Mission and Sullivan Underpass in Fremont, and step over the chain to the left of our gate and walk down to the metal container that we use as a ticket booth around 11:00 or 1:30 when the 10:30 and 1:00 trains comes there from Sunol.  They get back to Sunol around 1:50 and 2:20.

Bob Bailey, one of our members, lives there and if he asks you just tell him we said you could record the sounds there.

I have included a map of the railroad showing the locations.

We will be at the Sunol Depot ticket window this weekend if you stop by.","Thanks, Rich. Looking forward to it!"
,I forwarded your email to our steam department since they should know the best places to record the engine. I'm not sure if one of them will contact you directly or answer my email and I will send you the information. ,"Thanks, Donna. Looking forward to hearing from y’all."

probably dysentery and you should see a doctor",Romantic.
,"Hey all,
Just adding my mushiness to the general ""I miss you all!"" vibes, if after
a little delay in getting my shit together (update: shit is partially
together) and physically getting a computer set up from which to write this
- I cannot in all good conscience recommend moving house as a calendar
sandwich to going to Burning Man! My dad and I got back home safely, and I
made the wedding that I repeatedly moaned about having to rush off to (it
was really good!).
I had such a wonderful time with you all - I think I had expected a bit of
a party-party Burn, but fate and the weather conspired to give me a much
more thinky-thinky (and likely far superior) Burn to what I had expected.
It was more lovely than I could have reasonably expected to be reunited and
reacquainted with those of you I knew from before, and more so still to get
to know those of you who I hadn't met yet. Please do let me know if any of
you ever happen to be in ol' London town (and also maybe specifically in
the middle of October, as I have a housewarming planned). Apart from the
physical distance, enormous cost and inhospitable conditions, I don't know
why I spent eight years away.
Please do ping me a line if you'd like to connect over email, WhatsApp or
Facebook/Messenger (and also please forgive me if I don't get back
immediately, I am travelling around a bit at the moment and not always in a
position to respond).
Thanks doubly to Rat Queen Wednesday herself, for essentially carrying the
entire RATS endeavour on her back, and Chinchillin for letting me sleep
through my only kitchen shift, despite kinda-sorta-maybe-originally
actually being on the Kitchen Squad.

I gotta let our kitchen know asap what meals your team will need while you're here on 10/21-10/23 (trailblaze covers meals so don't worry about that weekend).

How many mouths you got and what is the first meal you will be here for (lunch or dinner on 10/21?) and when will your last meal be (breakfast or lunch on 10/23)?

Lastly, any dietary restrictions?

Thanks!","Good to hear from you!

Our schedule is a little flexy , But we can make some decent guesses. For Friday when we come up we will catch lunch on the way so we will need only dinner. And on Saturday we can make it only breakfast (The best meal of the day)

,I reworked the pictures.,"I love them.

Here's our Western Pacific BRC logo for you to use."
,I was going to order a couple more sets of your awesome playa dice. When I go to the checkout page it says there are no shipping options though. Am I able to buy these? Would they arrive (California) before the burn? Thanks!!,"Hmmm. That’s curious. I’ll give it a try. The dice should arrive well before the burn. 

Want to double check your shipping address?  If you were missing is ZIP Code or if you were missing a ZIP Code or something is the only thing I could see that would make shipping options unavailable."

My phone doesn't know what a .skp file is. What do I do??","SketchUp, brah. Use your computer."
,"I really enjoy this art idea and would like to contribute some art for this installation. Based on the dimensions and the format, I could easily make some of these pre-packed. Approximately how many of these would you like from each artist? Something of this nature would take me only a couple of weeks to knock out about 10-15 and if I press myself possibly 20 or more. My Playa name is Raven and I'll also be helping out with the Playa census. My home camp is Dragon Heights and we got placement at 7:15 & F this year, so if that is near your placement this year I could offer more help on the Playa. Depending I could also make time to help out depending on how it goes. Please let me know!","I don’t know how many yet! I was thinking 5? But 15 would just mean more the merrier. 

Would you be willing to make a little cigarette pack sized box for those to fit into? Dimensions are on the website. You could decorate the box any way you liked. 

Send to our HQ before August 1:

,"Sounds fun!
I just double checked; thought I dropped any photos and videos that I
took in that drive folder pretty soon after the burn. Turns out I had a
few photos and one short video clip of the golden spike ceremony that just
shows people waiting around on both sides of the tracks — that might be of
use. I've uploaded them to the same folder. Here's the link to the video:

and After Effects from time to time. But I expect you have a solid image of
the story you want to tell.","Thanks, Rhizome .

Can I ask for your notes and feedback once I put some rough biznatch
together?"
,"Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?

So grateful Wes! Now. Anything needed that I can truck in that would benefit the cause? Pick up a person a long the way?",Yes! Dill will want you to bring some foods!
,Was wondering also when the dice ship out and will likely arrive? Super excited to randomize my experience a bit with the playa pilot,We’re doing a big mailing tomorrow!
,"Good day! 
Here's the questions that I think need to be answered
a. Justin, did you apply for a low income ticket already? If no, then you're likely not eligible to purchase one. 
b. Also, if no, then you should use the free ticket from Wes. 
c. Wes, do you have an early entry pass for Justin? 
d. Finally, Justin, I believe you need a vehicle pass. Can you confirm how and when you plan to arrive on playa?
THANKS all",I have a ticket and an early entry pass for Justin and we will turn up a vehicle pass either through our network or by shuffling resources.
,"Hi Justin, sorry, I'm going to have to pass this upstairs. There was already a line for you in the Crew Spreadsheet, so you didn't need to create a new one, just update the existing one.

HOWEVER... that line had you receiving a free BM ticket as part of the BRS crew, but providing your own Vehicle Pass (VP). If you're saying you're now able to get a low-cost ticket, then I'd expect you'd be able to get a VP at the same time. But as the spreadsheet already has a free ticket allocated to you, that's beyond my pay grade, hence including Wes and Maggie in on this conversation.

Cheers,

Arthur",We’ll get this shit worked out. The process for me it’s like some kind of resource management RPG in which I have to shift resources around to different boxes to make sure everybody gets more or less what they need.

,"Helo friends,

I’m coordinating logistics for Alien Drive-Thru and I’m currently in the process of securing an EV heavy-duty pickup truck which, along with our 14’ car trailer, will tow our project to the Playa.

The project is light and packs up small, so we’re going to have a lot of space and weight left over. We’re also dedicated to taking as many ICE cars off the road as we possibly can this year, especially if those cars are low-MPG heavy-duty hauling vehicles.

I know we can do this because our crew has done it already — as lead producer of Awful’s Gas & Snack I secured a Tesla Model X and a car trailer to tow our project to Reno. Since 2019, the charging infrastructure in the area has improved, and I’ve made contacts in Gerlach and with heavy-duty mobile solar power projects to provide last-mile charging. This year, we’re going all the way to Black Rock City and back without burning gas.

We’re currently working out the details, but I know people are locking down their transportation plans now, so I wanted to reach out and gauge the interest of everyone here.

We will be leaving from the Bay Area and taking 80 to the Playa, and we can pick up anywhere along that route.

Please get in touch and let me know what your hauling needs are, and I will work quickly to confirm all the details for you.",This is sweet. I’m looking forward to meeting you all because your team seems to keep bringing the awesome.

,"Hello! I'm connecting you both about a ticket and potentially a VP. 
Essentially, Dill would like to sell a  ticket at low income price to you, Pao. 
You would send her the money, she will buy the ticket, and then Wes will send you the ticket that he has. 
The actual low income ticket is tied to Dill's identity. So we have to have her keep that one. 
Dill and Pao, I'll let you work out the details -- and then we'll just tell Wes what to do! ","And to be clear, I literally have no idea what form the ticket I will receive will take. I don’t know if it will have Dill’s identity linked to it and to her early entry pass or what. So just to say, there’s a measure of uncertainty here."

I'm sharing a special recorded message from the aliens behind Alien

Question for everyone running campaigns: how many people do you have
managing and producing the crowdfunding campaign for your project, and your
team size? And curious what you budget for it.
For Awful's, we hired a videographer and had someone solely dedicated to
the fundraiser, we were about 30 people. This time we went with an iPhone
and a tripod and all DIY at 20 people.
Happy $$ hunting,","For Black Rock Station, I did all the video, which can be a considerable
expense. All the social media and updates, etc were done by a team of two
and a half people, with the whole crew pitching in to spread the word.

The full crew is 16 people with only a few of us in the same
geographic space.

Thanks all for spreading the word about the station. The fundraiser was
successful and we reached goal in the final half hour (with some of our own
crew throwing down some big bucks to fill the gap)."
,I'd like my portion to go back to the project please!,Okay! Thanks Button. Tell me you are coming back to help us this year?
,"Hey Wes!
Thanks for the link! We will have a chat moderator sharing links during
the program. Have you submitted it to the Support a Project page? We have
had some problems with that page, but I think Kickstarter works okay. Also
make sure you send it to your Artist Liaison so it shows up on the art
listings page (if it isn't already on there).
See you tomorrow!","Yup, so far, I think we did all the things!"
,All present and correct,"Oh, thank the Jesus."
,"Gotcha, yeah, we should be able to tuck the delicate stuff away somewhere
on the container pad.
Although we won't be able to house you, we can get you fed with the rest
of our staff in the back of Bruno's for breakfast and dinner (plus we have
a make-your-own-sandwhich bar for lunches). What meals do you plan to be
here for? (I don't know exact times but it's probably breakfast: 6:30-8:30
and dinner 6-8, I'll confirm when I know).","Oh sweet. Thanks. Thinking Friday dinner, Saturday brekkie and dinner, and
Sunday brekkie."
,"So good to hear from you too.
Looking at the calendar. Assuming my people can get away on the weekend
best, I'm looking tentatively at Fri July 21st to Sun July 23rd. Would the
VR and a driver be around? In order to stage for Cuervo, would you be down
to see if we can sling the station to the pad? That would allow him to
Hyster it onto a truck whenever he had time and permission to put things
on-playa.
Another question is how many people we need to bring. If we could borrow
two folk we can lift rails to stage them for the VR. That would allow us to
come with a skeleton crew of 4.","Right now we are looking at coming up Fri July 21 to Sun July 23. My
skeleton crew is available. Would you have a few people for a couple of
lifts (less than an hour) and a VR around?

Could we squat a trailer in the trailer park or should we prepare to camp
or get a room at Brunos?"
,"You can definitely come early to disassemble and stage for transpo. We
will not have a VR on site until July 17th, so it'll have to be after that,
which is fine with us. We have another art group disassembling a piece that
requires the VR too on the weekend of 7/29. Wouldn't be impossible to help
you both at the same time, but it'd be slower for everyone.
Unfortunately we cannot offer any housing on The 360 because of permitting
issues that we have yet to sort out. Right now, your options would be
Bruno's hotel or camping on BLM land nearby. I will ask around and see if
we have anything to offer but I make no guarantees. How many people would
you bring out for early disassembly?

,Yes I do want to come. :),"OK, hang tight. We’ll get you sorted. Another important cultural norm at Burning Man is that people help each other. So we gotcha, fam."
,"o begin at the beginning, I don’t think I will be able to attend as I had planned. You might remember that I foresaw limits of the amount of time I could afford which put me and you all in an awkward position. Simply stated, I apologize for being so difficult and I thank you for everything you did to fill the gaps.

Torpedoing my goal to attend was the limited amount of parking passes Burning Man Incorporated afforded you and the project. As you know, I was interested in the set-up phase and then would have to leave in the middle of the weeklong event. Without a way to drive myself in and out, I could guarantee I could respond to an emergency at our adult foster home. The other torpedo is more important thought. We will be taking on two new clients and although I was sure this wouldn’t be a problem for my wife to handle while I was gone, some of them have medical appointments already planned and my attendance may be required. We are still working on backup help but it’s going slower than I thought it would.

So, there you have it. The story of my life. I have too many people that need me (translation: I may have made too many commitments too late in life ).

Annie, my wife, is not happy with my assessments  and demands that I follow through with attending. She is sure the many people in my life will culminate around me (her , us) and help make the situation work, but I have an eye for risk and this would require a small amount of miracles in a short amount of time.

In retrospect I realize that I knew so little about the nature of this process and it’s limitations. Honestly, I laughed at myself because I realized if I had just bought a ticket to The event, that would have allowed my ship to steer clear of one of the torpeDoes. 

I want to say thank you for including me in this adventure. This may not be working out, but I hope there’s next year and I hope your riverboat project will resume. I would also love to join you on a leg of any trip you might be planning. I plan on contributing to your projects not just because we have history, but because I believe in your work, and you.","There is a phrase that everyone at  Burning Man says and it’s trite, but it’s also true: “the Playa will provide.”

So, while it seems like you are blaming and second-guessing yourself, we were never that worried because shit always gets worked out.

So if we can find a vehicle pass for you, you still wanna come? Will Annie be okay with that? 

Don’t worry about letting us down. Our goal is to help create a context in which you can comfortably be yourself."
,"you can also send Kirsten a message, thank her for all the things she said in the brown bag lunch and tell her that you did what she suggested and went sent in the jrs... I'm guessing that would help making sure that she sees it...",Good suggestion! Done. Thanks

Good afternoon Wes,

Upon my first notice, I slicked the link and downloaded this...
<Screenshot 2023-07-23 at 5.05.20 PM.png>
I thought I was done until I received this in an email...


ACTION STILL REQUIRED re: your Burning Man art dept tickets/vehicle passes (honoraria)""


Then I went to the link again, ""checked out"" and received this...

<Screenshot 2023-07-23 at 5.02.30 PM.png>
...which looks like a ticket to the event. I of course understand that the WAP just gets you in early and allows you to drive in, but the regular ticket allows you to remain at the event when it officially opens with your vehicle.

I surmised that the WAP and Parking pass at the top gets me in with the art crew before the event and allows me to navigate my vehicle to its permanent location at camp and park.

After the second email notified me that I had not ""checked out"" I reviewed the info and complied.

I think I just completed my Jedi training.

Do I look ok? Does this email make me look fat?

PS: echoing Dill's comment in Slack, I am also quite envious of all of the pre- pre- setup hi-jinks depicted in the photos. Looks like a lot of hard work and fun.

PPS:

My Camp dues are paid. All I need is a decent tent...","though I have one concern. 

The wap allows you to get in before the event. Print that, packet with your stuff or in your car, and make sure you don't forget it. 

The ticket allows you to get in at all. Everyone need to take it even people just working before the event during Build Week. That, you will pick up at Wilco like you did last year.

What I'm not seen is your vehicle pass which you may have to check out similar to how you did your ticket. So look for that."

Hi Wes, thanks for your pledge. I will spread the word about Black Rock Station! Moonlight Outpost's origin story is that we came from a camp that did a ramen cart.

Are things coming together for you?
Thanks for the excuse to make art. Hi to Blintz!","That’s so exciting! I also really really love tiny things. And if I had my way, I would just make a tiny tiny little dioramas for the rest of my life.

,"!   Thank you for reaching out to us.
We loved the Black Rock Station.  I might have met you during build week;
I came over to your station on Wednesday or Thursday during construction,
and introduced myself to someone (perhaps yourself?) who explained that
they were the build lead, and then introduced me to the female architect
(is that Blintz?) who was leading the creative.  You guys had not yet laid
the train tracks.  I admired the aging you did on the exterior paint (great
color, too) and you explained how you achieved the effect.
Ironically we have in the past talked about having a little western town
out there with us, and it sounds like you had the same idea.
We do have some thoughts to share with you about it.  Although Sam and I
are disinclined to have the installations very close together (like, say,
The French Quarter), we do think being in a neighborhood with you and
others, with some distance, is intriguing.    Certainly there are a few
other suitable installations and even more prospective ones.  We would
welcome a creative conversation where we could hear your thoughts in more
detail, share our own, and discuss what might be mutually appealing.
I love your reference to Walmart and Applebees.  For years we’ve been
explaining the Bijou’s struggle to stay in business, what with the big new
multiplexes in town.   Much like Black Rock Station, the Bijou has a
backstory.  (Built in the early 1930s, furnished with hand me downs from
the original owner’s grandmother’s parlor in Elko.)
We loved having you as our neighbor and we welcome that creative
conversation.  Would you like to give us some times you and Blintz might be
available for a video call?
Let us know,
Cheers…","Sorry it took me so long to respond. You probably meant Jan, our chief
builder. Blintz and I are the lead artists. Sorry I missed meeting you.

I've still been thinking of the BRC Historic District. Especially, as we
get near the deadline for this year's Art LOI. I would be honored to be
near the Bijou again, though by my lights, I'd love to have them closer,
thought the sound of the station might affect the Bijou experience. What
were you thinking?

While there are camps through the years that I thought would be a good fit
for something like that, the number of interactive deep playa art pieces
that have a similar aesthetic is limited. What else have you thought of?"

Here's a reminder that your monthly update is due (on May 15)! This doesn't have to be a big thing. We’d love to see a sentence about your current progress, your next steps, and if there are any roadblocks on your way that we should discuss. Also 2-3 progress photos.
 Thank you! ","Sorry we are late with our update. After almost 2 years of intense work on the project, this last four weeks has been some thing of a pause for us.

Several of our primary artists were temporarily obligated to focus on work, family, and school. None of the sexy work on building, programming, or generating ephemera happened this month. Rather, it was an opportunity to take care of some of the administrative tasks necessary for a successful project. For example, things like:

Confirming crewmembers
Securing them tickets and work passes
Securing support like fuel from Hell Depot and heavy machinery from ASS
Ongoing fundraising efforts
Securing the loan of 6000lb of steel track from a local railroad
Tomorrow is the start of our big push.

,"A reminder that your monthly update was due yesterday. I'd love to hear
and see from you...
Cheers,","Welcome to the Ides of June.  Update due.

Project Management: I am focused on Fundraising, Build/Materials, Ephemera,
Train Recording, and shifting to Crew Care. That's a lot. The crew is
discovering for better or worse that details matter to me, so while I am
not ready to just turn over whole realms to others, with lots of good
communication I'm down to share some of the work! I'm learning! And I'm
also leaving for a week starting Monday, so things will have to happen
without me.

Crew & Tickets: Unchanged: We now have tickets and early entries for each
of the members of our crew who need them. This is huge and a huge relief
for me. We have limited vehicle passes, so carpooling is encouraged. Here's
our crew. Update your info. Thanks to our project manager, Parch.

Materials: We are starting to get construction material to assemble the
actual station. Beyond the critical stuff that has been clogging our
laboratory for months (speakers, electronics, swag), we are acquiring stuff
that is more detail-oriented (vintage office stool, dispatcher uniform,
A/C, that kind of stuff). Here is my big list of acquisition. If an item is
marked red or orange, we should worry. I am trying to transition everything
from orange/yellow to yellow/green (bench or field tested).

Station Build: Here is where good things are happening. Jan,
Jillian, Blintz, and I had our first weekly workday last weekend.
We removed nails from hundreds of scavenged 2x4s in prep for building the
wall panels. Jan started joking about the cost-benefit of 20 minutes
removing nails of a 2x4 that is available for $5 at Home Depot. That's
real. Though we'd like to use reclaimed material as much as possible, even
if it is more trouble. Jan is testing some materials and then we will have
a big materials purchase and start assembling panels at Jan's house. As
noted earlier: We've secured all of the heavy railroad equipment we need.
Some inventory and field testing needs to happen.

Speciality Build: Far as I know, no change. Nate is currently
working on a few speciality things he's offered to build with me, namely
the trackside speaker boxes, the window, the signal bridge trusses, and the
inside bench. In a subtle shift, I think he's now leaning toward being
on-playa, sso maybe your efforts to convince him were effective.

Fundraising: Marcella, Rhisome, Blintz, and I launched our
Kickstarter! This is a big deal. We are trying to raise $9,740 and are 20%
there so far. The Kickstarter ends on July 6th. If we don't reach our goal,
we get nothing. BM Arts provided about 1/3 of the costs, but we've had to
raise the other 2/3. We participated in the much-loved Desert Arts Preview
and expected a bump in contributions that didn't really happen. I spent
about a week total editing video for Desert Arts Preview and the
Kickstarter. Please check that out, and share the shit out of that bitch.

Systems: No change. I've put together and completed most of the electronic
and electrical systems. Jorge and I still have to do a few finishing
touches in prep for the playa. Programming date! On playa, I'm confident
that we have a solid tech team, including Jillian, Jorge, and
many of you technically savvy peeps.

Train Recording: Big changes here. I was hoping Larnie would be able to
draw our needed recordings from sound libraries, but after listening, I
suspected they were inadequate as foreground sound at realistic volumes
with no other mixed-in sound. With no visual train, visitors will be
hyper-focused on the audio and will readily notice unrealistic edits and
splices. Even to the degree that shortcuts won't be noticed consciously, I
think they will be picked up at some level at the cost of world-building
immersion (my philosophy for the greater project). SO... it turns out I
have a friend who was able to loan me a matched pair of really really
expensive mics and a kickass high-end recorder to do some field recording.
Working with Nate, we brainstormed very feasible locations to
do recordings. So with great borrowed equipment, I can go solo all over the
state to create the recordings we need, and Larnie can engineer these as
needed. Want to see more detail, you nerd? Okay, here you go.

Ephemera: Such a small thing, but so important. Rhizome, Blintz, and I
have been working hard on this. Railroad tickets we will give visitors to
the station, an accurate posted train schedule, altered/subverted magazines
in the waiting room, a trainhopper's guide to the future, a print
acknowledging Chinese and Black RR workers, stockholder certs for
kickstarter backers, art for our cigarette machine, and the researcher's
lost journal found in the waiting room. This all gets back to our
world-building philosophy, that all of these details matter, even if you
don't know the full story of their creation, even if you barely notice them
-- that richness and attention to detail, the way the paint peels on the
side of the station, or feels chalky like old paint contributes to a
feeling that this is real, that if you stay in the station, you might end
up in 1888 or 2066.

Crew Care: No change since last time. We now have a Crew Care Manager!
Please welcome Dill to this courageous and important job! Dill will
take responsibility for keeping us fed and watered. Responsibility, yes,
but not all the work. The task of cooking and watering us will rotate among
us. If you are interested in serving on the Crew Care Crew (C3?), let Dill
or I know.

That's it for now."

,"My name is Dylan, I am the interpreter at Bugsby Malone
State Park and the volunteer coordinator. First and foremost, I want to
apologize for the time it has taken me to reach out to you; I appreciate
your patience for my overdue response.
Please allow me to apologize on behalf of the entire park and the
volunteer program. As the volunteer coordinator, I can share with you that
Pete did not behave legally, appropriately, professionally, or in any
way that is synonymous with the volunteer trainings and enrichments we
require and provide. To be quite frank, the way that Mr. Moss handled the
situation, addressed you, and represented the park in general was very
egregious, and for that you have my deepest apologies. Furthermore, I
assure you that our trainings make it *very* clear about what we can, and
cannot ask in these situations, and also, how to approach these
conversations diplomatically (and in a way that connects and welcomes
visitors to the park). It is exceedingly clear to me that on Saturday, May
14th, this was not reflected in any of the park representatives’
behavior. So, I want to thank you for bringing this to our attention. It is
not something that we leave unaddressed and I appreciate you alerting us. I
will be speaking to all involved parties to correct this behavior.
Lastly, I’d like to share with you that I will also be scheduling a
mandatory training in the upcoming weeks to ensure that all volunteers pass
and demonstrate legal and correct procedures. I will be leaving a stack of
my business cards at the front desk of the Visitor Center, to ensure that
folks have a direct contact email to enable prompt communication.
Thank you Wes. Please feel free to save my contact information and if at
any point you would like to continue this conversation, please let me know.
With Apologies & Condolences,","Thank you.

It was clear that the volunteers, not just Mr. Moses, but the other docents
at the visitor's center were trying to redirect those with dogs to dog
friendly trails. Their message was entirely uniform, though not within the
law. I'll note that challenging me was their first approach rather than
asking if my dog was a service animal. I agree that Mr. Moses went entirely
too far, clearly suspecting that my dog was not a service animal and that
if so, she should be marked. These are all training issues, and so I'll
offer a few suggestions that you have no doubt already implemented.

I was inspired to create a flowchart that will make it clear to volunteers
what they may or may not ask, re service animals. It is attached. Please
let me know if it is helpful."
,"Yea! Raspberry pis have gone up astronomically because of the chip shortage. Aluminum extrusion costs went up, but not by as much as other metal prices.",That makes me glad I started on the electronics portion of our project with its 8 raspberry pies two years ago when we thought we were going to the desert with it.
,"I am checking in directly with the ASS manager as this is a very special
case. Will let you know what I hear and how I can help.","Circling back around to this.

Since we have a crew of 15 ready to prepare the station, dig in the
tracks, erect the signal bridge, billboard, and water tower... My biggest
concern is that we will all arrive on-playa ready to work and then will be
standing around until Wednesday stressing out waiting for the station to be
transported. So making sure that goes smoothly and at the right time in the
schedule reduces the stress on all of us.

The situation at 360 seems pretty weird right now with a lot of
uncertainty. I can sense the stress on Clamshell."

Good to hear the clarification. We're in the process of lining up folks to
come on Friday or Saturday.
Can you confirm how you're arriving? If you have a specific flight or
burner bus ticket?
Are you carpooling? If you're planning to drive, you need a vehicle pass -
which we don't have any available at the moment.
If you're coming via the burner bus - you can get tickets to arrive on
Saturday without needing a work pass.

setup — I can’t remember from my interview if we talked about my being part
of the setup crew for the train station project, or just Camp Blarg… Would you
mind letting me know arrival days for each, and which project you need
people for?
Many thanks, and sorry for my forgetty spaghetti!","unfortunately. The best thing about Camp Blarg for me
is that, despite starting it and running it for years, they let me come
back as just a helpful schmoe, who Doesn't know anything.

Thanks!","Yes, there is a 70 acre lot  for sale just to the west of that lot. How much is it listed for?"
,"They may come down a little on price, but probably not too much. I sold

i cant thank you enough for the gift that you have given us, so i really
hope we are not letting you down.
","Sure. I understand. I want to plan around it. Should I put you down as
arriving on Wednesday for now? That would allow me to assign the early WAPs
to Wednesday and Xray who would like to come earlier.

- do we have EAP through you folks? Or should I arrange with Camp Blarg?
- how will the half price tickets work? Rhizome  and I both bought stewards
for Camp Blarg. So not sure how it goes with allocation of the half price.
❤️❤️","Answers:

- when do you want Rhizome  and I  there?

Monday 22 Aug. All the cool kids will be there.

- Camp Blarg ordered water. Should get it delivered early. We can get a refill
with cash during the burn. So, when should we get it brought?

Mon 22 Aug or Tue 23 Aug?

- do we have EAP through you folks? Or should I arrange with Camp Blarg?

Currently, I have you set up to have early entry through BRS. How early
will they allow early entry for Camp Blarg. These things have dates attached to
them. A few people are coming later than others, so if we need to shift
them around we can.

- how will the half price tickets work? Rhizome  and I both bought stewards
for Camp Blarg. So not sure how it goes with allocation of the half price.

I have no idea, honestly. Assuming they will ask me at some point who's
name should be on each."

Dear UCSC Lecturers,

Today is the deadline for the University to issue reappointment letters for next year.  Everyone who worked this year should be considered for reappointment before any new hires are made.  This means that with very few exceptions, everyone who worked as a pre-sixer this year should be getting at two year reappointment with at least the same appointment percentage in each year as you have this year.  If you don't get a reappointment letter by the end of the day today, or you get one for a reduced percentage or for only one year, please get in touch ASAP.  New contract language will allow us to fight non-reappointments in some cases, but we have to catch it within thirty days of today!  Below is the link that I sent out a few weeks ago with our non-reappointment survey.   If you have not yet done so, please fill it out! 

You can let them know by filling out this non-reappointment form.

It is extremely important for our union's contract enforcement efforts to fill out this form if you do not receive a reappointment letter for the Fall. 
We all need to work together as a community to make sure the contract is being implemented in good faith. Our goal is to address non-reappointments at the level of the Dean. The statewide leadership needs an accurate assessment of these non-reappointment numbers. Thanks very much for your help!

In Solidarity",All good over here. Art beat the deadline by a month and a half. Computational Media got me the letter just under the deadline

As a good bureaucrat, I will have read, memorized, and filed (...somewhere...) the Artist Handbook. Delighted to support crew care. :)","Yay! Please do memorize it. Then you can be the first person I ask my dumb questions rather than bothering our BMOrg contacts. 

Despite everything, I’m also really good with bureaucracies."
,"Great! Sounds like you're all set. It's hard to know what part of the week will be busiest for HEaT. Earlier is likely better, but if you can be flexible on when you need their assist with the signal bridge, that would be best. Your ASS squad will make sure you get into HEaT's queue when you tell them you're ready.

See you soon in the dust!",We are nothing if not flexible!
,"I hope all is going well with your build! I'm looking forward to seeing
you and your artwork out on the playa in just a few months.
We received your responses to our ASS Resource Request form, and I'm
finally following up on your questions (I know you've been in touch with
JRay as well):
1) HEaT can likely help you with augering holes, but it's great if you
have a backup tool to do them by hand if need be, as you discussed with
JRay. We're limited by the BLM to holes that are 1'x1'x3' deep; can you
make that work? You'd mentioned 4' deep holes.
2) I'm sure we can get a VR to help you raise the signal bridge. HEaT runs
on a request queue, not a schedule, so just let your ASS squad know when
you're ready for the assist, and they'll get you in the queue.
3) Have you heard from the PETROL team confirming your registration in the
fuel program? They are still processing registrations through 6/15, so they
may not have started their reach outs yet.
Cheers,","1) HEaT can likely help you with augering holes, but it's great if you have

We'll bring a posthole digger as a backup. And yes, we can stop at 3'. That
will be fine.

Awesome. Assembling the bridge before we put up the posts is likely to
damage the bridge, and we would have a challenge getting the bridge up on
the posts without a lift after they were up. Assembling the signal bridge
will be mid to later in the week for us. We could move that up if it makes
things easier to schedule for HEaT.

3) Have you heard from the PETROL team confirming your registration in the
fuel program? They are still processing registrations through 6/15, so they
may not have started their reach outs yet.

I have. I think I tried to fill out the form 3 times after getting
increasingly urgent emails before realizing I'd already done it n March
when first suggested. So I wrote and asked them if they had us in the
queue. They reassured me that yet, we're good."
,"
I think four weeks from now sounds perfect.
It will give us the added urgency!",Okay! Perhaps we can spend the four weeks setting up the Kickstarter and generating interest.

Some notes: I guessed on pronunciations, and cribbed a guide Robert
Kealiher offered last year to do his, hope i got it right.
Went for old timey more formal voices for the earlier time periods, a
little more casual for the 1980s, then by 2014 the announcer was as fed up
as everyone with capitalism therefore is kinda fed up all the time -- and
in 2110 (which I recall returns to a human-scale, hand-crafted, rootsy
mode) she's playful and loving and not at all official. Took a chance and
googled some of the names who provided no text and played with either their
names, their vocation (assuming I googled the right them) or in the first
one's case pinned to it an innovation of the age.
 I called all the soundfiles by what was in the ""name"" column, but tho' I
called them all .mp3s they all saved as .m4as, hope that's not too much of
a bother.
Anyway, fun project, would do again, and the trimmed originals are still
on my phone in voice memos just in casies.
Have fun out there!

PS what's with Anna Zevallos anyway, she is endlessly losing her shit!","These are wonderful! I like the playful feel of many of them. This year
there will be more puzzle box shenanigans, since last year, to our

,"Based on the clean-up effort found during my last visit to the property, the complaint as written was closed. Moving forward, I encourage you to maintain your property free from accumulated stored materials.
 
Thank you,","So since you were here two summers ago, the next door neighbor who reported me ironically appears to have abandoned the house leaving large piles of trash everywhere in view of the street.

We spent that whole summer moving the chicken coop, building sheds for materials, and cleaning up the lot, all at the demand of a guy who hasn’t been back to his house more than a couple times in the last two years. A guy that himself keeps his rental house in disrepair and puked in trash. 

What do they say about people in glass houses?"
,"Here’s the letter. I don’t have a printer functioning now at home, but if
you need a signed copy, I can print it up next week when I get into the
office and put it in the mail, or leave it in the pick-up box on the 4th
floor at the County Building. Please let me know…","Thank you.

I know that you have enough on your plate with your own evacuation and
expediting the permit process for those who've lost homes in the area. So
thank you for taking the time to write this letter. It is a huge relief and
we can go into the Fall 2020 school year without that distraction.

I appreciate the professionalism you have shown this issue and I will
continue to maintain as I did since my earliest interactions with code
compliance that the focus of the department is not to make things harder
for landowners, but ensure that neighborhoods are safe, well-cared for, and
meet county standards."
,"I am in the same boat as you, moving back in today. Glad you were spared,
as so many others have not been. Marcus is assisting in damage assessment
inspections for the next few weeks and many code enforcement efforts are
being delayed as staff are shifted to where they are needed to help in
recovery, myself included. That said, I will do my best to get a letter out
detailing your efforts to date. Last I heard you were planning on
relocating the noisy hen, which was the last item. As I have heard nothing
since from complainants, I assume she was relocated. If you will confirm
that I’ll add it to my letter.","I'm glad your house was spared. I absolutely appreciate the shift in focus
of your department. This tempest in a teacup is small beans compared to the
real damage that so many people have experienced. Many of my SLV friends
have lost homes.

Marcus stopped by and took photos the Friday before we were evacuated and
saw that the noisy hen/would-be rooster was relocated. Interestingly, the
rooster was in another area threatened by fire and was relocated to a flock
in rural Corralitos. The noisy hen hasn't been here for several weeks now.

My impression was that Marcus wanted to show you the photos and see if it
met your expectations. At this point our yard is quite tidy by the
standards of the rural residential area of the San Lorenzo Valley.

Since Marcus visited, we have rebuilt a somewhat rickety fence and planted
a garden down at the end of the lot.

Thanks for your help."
,Matt Johnston is out of the office this week. We will have a response for you early next week.,"I hope that neither of you were affected by the fires in San Lorenzo Valley and elsewhere. We were evacuated about two weeks ago and just returned yesterday. The fire got within 600 feet of our neighborhood and within a quarter-mile of our house. We felt very lucky to have our house still standing. It was touch and go for a while.

The gravity of the very real threat to our home has cast a vivid light on the absurdity of the situation: a neighbor who doesn't even use the house next-door as a residence - and has been doing an unpermitted full remodel for a year - abusing and manipulating the code compliance process to bully and harass another neighbor. 

We have literally spent our entire summer, more than a month of labor patiently dealing with compliance issues that have stood for well over a decade and were bothering no one. At this point, I am out of both patience and time. Now I return to work full time teaching fall semester. 

I have satisfied every requirement detailed in the cleanup plan that Marcus approved over a month ago. I enjoyed dealing with both of you, but now I would like to be done with the process.

Matt, you offered to send us a letter that detailed our compliance with the code. I would like to take you up on that offer.

Thank you for your time. "
,Thank you for the update. I will drive by your property Friday – if you are on site we can meet if you like.,"Thank you for visiting last Friday, Marcus. You mentioned that you would show your photos to Matt and see if he thought we had met county standards. I am anxious to hear what you guys think.

As for the loud hen who thought she was a rooster, I think you can see from Marcus‘s photos that she is not here. She is now living her best life with a new flock where she won’t bother anyone.

As for the yard cleanup, I’ll note that we did everything that was within the cleanup plan that Marcus approved several weeks ago, attached here.

If everything meets your approval, Matt, I would like to take advantage of your offer to send us a letter that says we took care of everything. I’d appreciate that.

Thanks again for your attention."
,Would approx. 11AM work?,Yes. See you approximately then.
,Thank you for the update. I will drive by your property Friday – if you are on site we can meet if you like.,That would be fine. Any particular time?
,"It looks great, Wes. We appreciate the work you’ve done out there.  The only outstanding issue is the she-rooster.  Once I have confirmation that the bird is no longer in the brood I am happy to provide such a letter. Marcus can provide you with an affidavit or if he has the time can do a site visit to confirm. I’ll leave that up to him.",Here she is in her new home.

East Bay Burners is compiling The Northern California Directory of Art Projects - a directory of Playa-bound projects coming from artists throughout Northern California and Nevada. The directory will be published and promoted on social media and in our newsletter in order to help connect aspiring volunteers with artists who need them.
 
As I'm sure you know, the Northern California community has a LOT of people with a variety of skills, from swinging hammers to fundraising, to logistics, to bookkeeping. Local Burners and the Burner-curious are eager to get involved, and this directory is a way to help them help you! We hope that by creating this directory and making it available to our constituents, we'll be able to help you generate more awareness of your project.
 
We'd love to include Black Rock Station in the directory. If you’re interested, please take a few minutes to complete this short 9 question Art Project form.
 
We're super excited for your project!","In terms of gathering volunteers, we don’t really have that need. But I love networking with other artists."

since been buried over the last 20 years. He told me that he angled the
leach field to avoid a couple of existing trees while trying to maintain
maximum distance from the ephemeral creek. From the excavated riser pipes,
the plan he prepared for your department, and what he told me, I was able
to make what I believe is an accurate drawing of our septic system.

The shape of the garage was designed to avoid what I thought was the
existing leach field. What are your thoughts here?

If this works for your department, I can prepare the more formal plan for
the planning department."
,"I was wondering if you had any office hour availability today, if not when
would be a good time to meet up? I was having some trouble with getting my
CCS to link to my HTML in atom on the last lab and wanted some help finding
a solution","My next office hours is the Monday when we return. However, if you put a
link to your page in a DM on Slack and articulate the problem you're
having, I'll bet I can figure it out pretty quick when I get a moment."
,"Hi there!

I back-ordered these a couple months ago (waited too long after I saw they were in) and was wondering if there is a timeline when they’ll be available again. I’m looking forward to getting them, I’ve been gifting these like crazy and my friends are all so excited!

Thank you so much for everything!!!","The new ones are currently being manufactured. We were originally thinking they would arrive late April but there was a shut down at the Chinese factory where they’re being made, so it might be delayed a couple week.  But we’re still good probably for early May."
,"Happy to support y’all seems like an awesome project! 

Any chance shipping across all four items can be bundled to save a bit? Fine waiting til whatever last item becomes ready… no worries if not!",That is exactly what we’re going to do. Will ship everything at the same time. Thanks for your patience.
,"Hi, this is Richard. I'll like to know if I got the right contact for a graphic designer? Kindly get back to me.","I teach design, but don’t do much work as a designer generally. Did you get my contact from somebody?"

,"Wes, 
Thank you for the update and insight. Our team is ready to help you any way we can. Just let us know your decision :)",Did you get more info about that Mojave property?
,"Yes, I am Nate's Buyer's Specialist so I typically assist in purchase transactions and client inquiries. Samantha is our internal admin and also assists in the background. Our team is dedicated to ensuring the best overall experience so we all help each other. :)
Thank you for the congratulations! It is exciting. 
I should have the agent information soon and will reach out from there.","Okay great. Thanks. 

I should give you an update on the Caliente property. The selling agent was Dale from Tehachapi. He seemed like a nuce fella. I told him I had a hard limit at 48K (because that is literally the max amount I could get out of my equity at the moment). He presented that as a serious offer to the client who is in the midst of transferring ownership from a family trust to his own trust. The owner did not want to consider an offer so low at this time.

So, though I prefer that Caliente property, I may have to make an offer later when he has come down, or after my current loan offer expires and  I have to redo the application, perhaps my house will be reappraised and I will have more money available."
,"Kelsey with Nate's team here. I wanted to reach out to you

company - Castle Oak Homes - and are using a new system. So, I decided to
email you from the new one here.

,"Thank you for getting back to me, to make things easier for everyone I’m
just going to loop Wes into this thread, as I know that I do not have all
the information that you require.
Thank you again,","I don't think there was an email thread because we talked on the phone. I
talked to WIlly on Mar 4th, 2020. Here are my notes:

Talked to Willy. He agreed that it happens (rarely) that a forklift yahoo
will spear a container with the business end of a forklift. He's happy to
repair it. Since our stuff is in it and he Doesn't want to catch that on
fire, the easiest way is to weld a patch on-playa that will restore it to
its past glory as an insulated container. Hours worth of work at most.
He'll take care of the cost.


The damage is minor, all things considered, but Does expose our contents to
the elements, so we would like it taken care of. It looks like someone
intended to pick up the container with a forklift, missed, and put the
tine through the side of the container near the bottom. If I remember
right, it was on the long side to the left facing the door, on the end
nearest the door.

Hopefully, that answers some questions."

Thank you!","Sure. Camp Blarg is at 6 o’clock and H near the 6 o’clock plaza.

,"Raymond Craib calls these experiments “libertarian exit"" and his new book,
Adventure Capitalism, is a global history of this ideology and practice.

Imagine a capitalist paradise. An island utopia governed solely by the
rules of the market and inspired by the fictions of Ayn Rand and Robinson
Crusoe. Sound far-fetched? It may not be.
The past half century is littered with the remains of such experiments in
what Raymond Craib calls “libertarian exit.” Often dismissed as little more
than the dreams of crazy, rich Caucasians, exit strategies have been tried
out from the southwest Pacific to the Caribbean, from the North Sea to the
high seas, often with dire consequences for local inhabitants. Based on
research in archives in the US, the UK, and Vanuatu, as well as in FBI
files acquired through the Freedom of Information Act, Craib explores in
careful detail the ideology and practice of libertarian exit and its place
in the histories of contemporary cap­italism, decolonization, empire, and
oceans and islands.
Adventure Capitalism is a global history that intersects with an array of
figures: Fidel Castro and the Koch brothers, American segregationists and
Melanesian socialists, Honolulu-based real estate speculators and British
Special Branch spies, soldiers of fortune and English lords, Orange County
engineers and Tongan navigators, CIA operatives and CBS news executives,
and a new breed of techno-utopians and an old guard of Honduran coup
leaders. This is not only a history of our time but, given the new
iterations of privatized exit—seasteads, free private cities, and space
colonization—it is also a history of our future.
Help get this important book into the world so we can better understand
the history and future of libertarian exit, identify the elites
perpetuating this destructive practice, and develop more strategies for how
to stop them. Learn more on the new Kickstarter

preorder the book, and see all the rewards such as the book + Mutual Aid
shirt. Thanks in advance for your support!
Raymond Craib","Wow, I can't tell you how unexcited I am to get this in my email box this
morning."
,"I'm sending this out to everyone who donated to my medic campaign.

I just got word that I passed my didactic examinations and received a cumulative score of an ""A"" for the in-class portion of the program.

I want to say that the past 8 months (2 semesters) have gone by quickly but it's been more like a sloth stuck in molasses trying to climb a mountain. Honestly, without your support this process would have been much more difficult. All of us have ups and downs as we move forward in time together and I am no different. The suicide of my father, torn muscle in one of my arms, and walking pnumonia for 2 months were definite challenges during this process but we learn from everything we experience.

What I didn't have to worry about was gas money, a comfortable place to stay, and food to eat. For that I am truly grateful.

What's next for me is a month doing clinical rotations in the hospitals, then a 3 months field internship with a local ambulance company, then the final national exams.

Seems like a lot but I'm more than halfway done!

I would not have been able to do this without you.

,"OMG I was so swamped with school and stuff this past few months I missed this. Somehow school has been harder back in person but not for the reasons I thought. I was so worried about teaching in a mask and kids being out sick with covid but somehow that was not the problem at all, it had so much more to do with the world around us and how it has been affected by the pandemic but also, well, you know, all that other crazy stuff that capitalism as wrought around the world....","OMG, yes! I know EXACTLY what you mean. Teaching is no easier or harder than it’s always been (yes masks, yes students out in isolation or quarantine), but there is a new undefinable… something. For me, it just feels like I forgot how to be social. When we return to in person classes, my students were really excited, amazing attendance, etc. and now they just look overwhelmed and that’s how I feel… like seeing people, talking to people, being in their presence, actively listening, OMG kill me. I am a secret introvert, though I play a social person in the classroom and in the gallery. During the pandemic, like a lot of people, I forgot how to pretend that I’m not completely overwhelmed by all these people. Plus this term I’m doing a crazy thing I have not done before. And as an adjunct, if they offer me a class, regardless of the timing, regardless of how crowded my schedule, if I ever want the opportunity to teach that class again, I have to jump at it. So as a result, this term I am teaching SIX full classes with a total of about 500 students at two universities. Happily only one of them is new, but that’s intense enough. So my weeks are something like 80 hour weeks. Crazy. But happily the School schedules only partially overlap so in a month I will shed four of those classes. I’ve been reading about the opera — that sounds fun. We'll see what we can do for a visit sometime soon."
,"It looks like I am good to apply for this with you if you'd like. My grant was the 2020-2021 round, and it looks like only 2021-2022 recipients are excluded. The only potential hurdle I'm seeing is that they say the project's start date should not be earlier than 7/1/22. I guess it really depends on what they consider to be the start date. Certainly the public-facing part is well after that, but I wonder if all the work already completed might be a problem there. It could be worth running that question by staff, though, just to make sure. I'm guessing you've already got versions of a bunch of what they want in the application in place, so maybe the application process won't be too intensive.","Let's consider the start of the project on 7/2/2022. At least the collaborative part, doing the recordings won't happen before then. If you complete what you can, faking what you don't know, I can take a swipe and get what you didn't and look at what you made up."
,"I'd like to volunteer I have a radio show on Tuesdays, every other Tuesday, and tonight is my Tuesday starting from seven till 9 PM. If I give you my phone number, you can give me a call and see if you’d like to talk about your art project. We can talk for up to one hour if we time it right.

Check it out and tell me if you think it needs changes

Good day all you amazing Black Rock Station people!!

Your Crew Care Team has come up with some tasty options for meals during build week while we all are diligently laboring to create the reality of the dream of Black rock Station! I believe all of you have received and read the kitchen notes for Coscto ( If you haven't received them, let me know, I will forward them to you!) So we will try not to be too redundant on those notes! Everything about the kitchen during burn week holds true for build week, with the exception of signing up for shifts.

Your Crew Care Team for Build week consists of Wednesday, Button and I, but at any time if anyone would like to join in with us for a bit, you are more than welcome!

What will your Crew Care team be doing during build week you may wonder? Well.... I'm here to lay it on the line. First and foremost.... we care about you! Yes you!! We want to make sure everyone has what they need to feel good in body, mind and soul! You're thirsty? We will make sure there are cold drinks to cool your throat. You're tired? We will guide you to a nice, shady spot with chairs and lounges to rest. You're feeling down or frustrated? Awkwardly long hugs are our specialty! Hungry? We have a wonderful menu of meals and snacks!

We do ask that you come with your normal preparations for self care ... Sunscreen, proper attire, work gloves, eye protection, medications and very importantly, some personal drinking water! Although we will be setting up a water and electrolyte station, we want to be prepared in case it takes a little longer than expected to get out water tank.... Please plan to bring at least a gallon or two per person for possibly 2 to 3 days. This way we won't be panicked if the water tank delivery is late. 😊

I will be posting the weeks menu below. Wednesday, Button and I will have meals ready for breakfast and dinner, and we will bring snacks and fresh cold drinks out to the station for mid day to keep everyone going! There will be two 5 gallon coolers at the station we will keep filled, one with electrolyte water, and the other with just water. Please make sure to bring your cups with you! Our Care Crew will also jump in and help at the station when not doing care stuff, and we encourage station builders to join us in care team work if that would fill them with joy, or if they need a break from building.... just let us know! We are here to help everyone do the thing they love doing, as we will be doing the thing we love doing! Taking care of all of you!

So, without any further ado..

The build week menu!

Monday Dinner: Build your own lunch meat and chicken salad sandwiches, Assorted chips, Pam, Cup cakes
Tuesday morning: Eggs to order, Bacon, toast, hash browns, Orange slices
Tuesday Dinner: Tex Mex style Salad, Chocolate cake
Wednesday Breakfast: Biscuits and gravy, Scrambled eggs, Bacon and mixed berries
Wednesday Dinner: Beef lasagna ( Veg lasagna option), Tossed salad, garlic bread, cheese cake dessert with fruit and whip cream toppings
Thursday Breakfast: French Toast, Sausage links or patties, Melon bits (Scrambled eggs or omlette for keto option)
Thursday Dinner: Chicken Alfredo with broccoli, Rolls and mixed salad, Pie
Friday Breakfast: Build your own Breakfast burritos, orange slices
Friday Dinner: Jambalaya, corn bread, Strawberry shortcake
Saturday Breakfast: Cheesy ham and egg scramble, English muffins and jam, bacon, Grapes

Every morning we will have coffee and Orange juice! Please note some of these are subject to change at the whims of your kitchen overlords... oh... wait.... wrong group.... I mean.... subject to change depending on circumstances","This is brilliant, Dill. It feels compassionate and loving and competent. 

I have only a few suggestions. I know that at least one camper was concerned about water, so specifying a specific quantity would probably be helpful for them. I suggest 5 gallons per person total will be more than enough. Also possibly helpful to mention that our water is scheduled to be delivered the day before any of us arrive.

The second thing: this might be a good opportunity to get the crew prepared for our daily work schedule, particularly our early meal time. We’ll be starting in the early morning, working before it gets too hot. Taking a brief break & snack in the hottest part of the day. And then a evening dinner with time enough to either work a little later or to decompress with cocktails.

The last thing is a reminder that people should bring personal emergency snacks for themselves (and to share) since there is a good stretch between breakfast and dinner

Of course all of our plans are flexible. I believe in leading through following. So if there’s a strong desire to eat breakfast and start work later or the crew wants to eat dinner earlier or everyone wants to work in the middle of the night instead of the daytime, we’ll do what we can to accommodate the team. This is a team effort and it will take all of us working together.

I’m excited for the crew care email to go out."
,"HAHA yes. I think people are really protective of the MFA degree since it is one of the only masters degrees that you can have and still get a tenure track teaching job.

The pay/work that you shared is depressing. WTF. Labor in academia needs to be addressed like RIGHT NOW. I think we should all throw down on strike again until it is fixed. That would mean redirecting gov spending back into public education again, which we know how that goes over. We need to force the issue. 

At this point we are feeling like we want to stay in the bay area (we just moved twice to sell home and then into our new one) so I dont want to do that again. I also love the community here. If the job was REALLY exciting, I might consider moving, but prob not for a while. At this point the back up plan is to continue doing my work at Santa Cruz and also adjunct teach at Berkeley, while continuing to do research/create art. All the things that I love!

I think we will see difficult and major shifts in our lifetime. My partner Owen worries about this more than I do - I spend much more anxious energy on my kids short term safety (and also things like wildfire keep me up at night). I guess we just keep doing the work of teaching creative thinking and compassionate community building. ","Im at a UCSC retreat and thinking about you, about your work, and about your journey. 

I just reread what you wrote about hiring in the arts division. And was thinking about diversity and how awesome it is to meet these ground-breaking new faculty who wouldn’t be represented in the university when I was an undergrad, and maybe not even 10 years ago. 

In that light, I guess I’m grateful that the candidates the department interviewed for the EASP position were super talented BIPOC folks. Though they didn’t contact me for an interview, at least those they did got it going on. 

Not at all to diminish your grumbly feelings. Given your scholarship and contributions to EASP, I still hope they find a faculty place for you at UCSC. 

But the experience has definitely given me thought around my dream of teaching/researching at an R1 school. In short, watching the research presentations of prospective faculty, I felt as a scholar I was out of my depth. 

So I had to ask myself a number of hard questions. Why was I doing this? What did I really want? From the beginning I just want to make art. I like teaching. But teaching just gives me space, time, and sometimes resources to make art. Teaching as an adjunct is a grind. Tenure at a CalState is unappealing if it doesn't include resources or even time for research. And tenure at a UC seems increasingly distant. 

So that left me with some open questions: Is tenure at an R1 or R2 realistic for me? Are there other ways I can make space, time, and resources for art? If I’m not tethered to a particular school and location, where do I want to be?  

I think those are questions I’ve asked before and unknowingly always working to answer. 

I wrote an essay I thought you would like that grapples with some of these questions. 

https://medium.com/@wesmodes/the-important-question-where-do-i-belong-8e2fed31510d

I’d love to hear your thoughts and what co es up for you around this. 

Yours,"

https://shantyboatliving.com/2021/interview-with-wes-modes/ The recording
from the Morven museum was posted, so you can check it out.

Yeah, I agree with Owen. We will see major shifts. If nothing else from
Global Climate Change and extreme wealth inequality. I'm willing to put up
with a lot of disruption if it brings us closer to enjoying a world with
more equity and justice. I think someday, probably due to absolute chaotic
shit-hitting-the-fan necessity, we are going to create a society based on
something other than the hoarding of wealth and power. Or as Ursula Le Guin
said, “We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the
divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human
beings. Resistance and change often begin in art, and very often in our
art, the art of words.” Whether this happens in our lifetimes, I don't
know. Maybe not, but maybe. I can't find the quote, but Howard Zinn put it
well. I tried to capture it in a comic I wrote with him. Here's the last
panel."
,"I applied to a few positions - one at Sonoma State that looked so cool,
but I submitted late, so there was little chance that it would be reviewed
(the rules are only if they reject all of the ""on time"" submissions can
they consider others). Another position was the environmental artist
position at UCSC they hired last year, and they hired Jorgge Barreto (from
Brazil). That one burned because (I was told) that my work forging new
territory in environemntal art at UCSC helped the department to get that
new major created. I applied to a painting position at University of
Washington, but it was pretty clear that they wanted a ""classic"" painter.
The feedback I got in all cases was that many people thought that I should
have an MFA, and it was different from a PhD. Lucky enough, I landed an art
residency at Berkeley for two years and they agreed to give me an MFA as
part of it (fully funded) with studio space on the bay! I am feeling really
lucky about that.
 I don't think Enrique gets to count as diversity since he is from Spain -
I equate Western European with white colonialism : ) But he Does speak
spanish which is so important considering so much of the Santa Cruz
population is spanish speaking.
You are right about UCSC teaching ""ideas"". My ideal curriculum is idea
based, strong anti-racist/facist framing, but with some number of projects
created that can be used or pointed to on a CV to get jobs. I worry about
students being able to find meaningful work after an art degree.
Yes - so many new projects that I would love to tell you about! My website
is out of date. They will have to wait for a time when I am visiting. LEt
me know if you all find your way to Berkeley. We actually sold our Oakland
home (so tired of the constant armed muggings in the neighborhood), and
found a very special home in North Berkeley. My stress level has
evaporated. I really love our neighborhood. Jack started kinder at a public
school down the road and it is wonderful. Very diverse and supportive
community!
Take care,","Wait, are you shitting me? You got feedback that your PhD didn't cut it,
and they would have rather you had an MFA? ::laugh to keep from crying
emoji::

Are you applying as far afield as Seattle? Wow. That's a part of academia
I'm not stoked about. The expectation that you should be willing to pick up
your whole fucking life and move somewhere else.

Sonoma State, huh? It is hard not to be soured on CalState from my
experience at CSUMB. I swear I've never been treated better by an employer,
with so much concern and respect, and yet, it still sucks. The pay is
fucking criminal. When I teach 3 classes -- that's 12 hr/wk in the
classroom plus 2x that for prep, grading, etc. 36 hrs a week plus faculty
meetings, curriculum dev, MLO evaluation, student club sponsorship, hosting
student events -- I net $24,540. On top of that, teaching schools don't pay
you or give you service credit if you are TT, for working on your research,
so to do that at all, it is all stolen time. I complain about this all the
time and am actively involved in my union, but no change likely on the
horizon. The chancellor makes 30 times more than I do working full-time. As
I tell Blintz, it's a shitty job, but the best shitty job I've ever had.

I think soon we are going to have to think beyond work and jobs. Very soon,
maybe sooner than any of us are ready for. And those who have been focused
on ideas are going to be in a better position. Intersectionality, mutual
support, anti-racism, anti-oppression, anti-colonial -- these are ideas
that will serve us best in a future where there is increasingly no place
for any of us in the corporate/industrial factory. So my CSUMB students
will get jobs RN, but will be completely flummoxed when there are no jobs
to be had.

Just more thoughts, I guess.

Come down and drink/talk with us on a rainy Friday!"
,"I applied to a few positions - one at Sonoma State that looked so cool,
but I submitted late, so there was little chance that it would be reviewed
(the rules are only if they reject all of the ""on time"" submissions can
they consider others). Another position was the environmental artist
position at UCSC they hired last year, and they hired Jorgge Barreto (from
Brazil). That one burned because (I was told) that my work forging new
territory in environemntal art at UCSC helped the department to get that
new major created. I applied to a painting position at University of
Washington, but it was pretty clear that they wanted a ""classic"" painter.
The feedback I got in all cases was that many people thought that I should
have an MFA, and it was different from a PhD. Lucky enough, I landed an art
residency at Berkeley for two years and they agreed to give me an MFA as
part of it (fully funded) with studio space on the bay! I am feeling really
lucky about that.
 I don't think Enrique gets to count as diversity since he is from Spain -
I equate Western European with white colonialism : ) But he Does speak
spanish which is so important considering so much of the Santa Cruz
population is spanish speaking.
You are right about UCSC teaching ""ideas"". My ideal curriculum is idea
based, strong anti-racist/facist framing, but with some number of projects
created that can be used or pointed to on a CV to get jobs. I worry about
students being able to find meaningful work after an art degree.
Yes - so many new projects that I would love to tell you about! My website
is out of date. They will have to wait for a time when I am visiting. LEt
me know if you all find your way to Berkeley. We actually sold our Oakland
home (so tired of the constant armed muggings in the neighborhood), and
found a very special home in North Berkeley. My stress level has
evaporated. I really love our neighborhood. Jack started kinder at a public
school down the road and it is wonderful. Very diverse and supportive
community!
Take care","Oh what is your mailing address, ""institutional affiliation"", and ""job
title""?"
,"I was just thinking about you, its nice to hear from you. I wanted to attend your Princeton talk but I shied away from the fee. In retrospect I wish to have see it - any chance to catch a recording?

I am definitely happy to write a letter for you if you make it to the second round. They would be lucky to have you. 

I probably will not apply as I was a little disheartened by the last Santa Cruz application process and I have so much on my plate at the moment. From my understanding they are really committed to diversity hires (which is great!), but means most likely they will not be hiring any white people unless they are over the top famous. I think the art department is pretty embarrassed by its mostly white composition. 

Regardless, applying is generally a good practice, and the selection will come down to who throws their hat in the ring. But the candidate pool last time was incredibly diverse with excellent artists. 

The competition these days is so crazy. I keep having informational interviews with really amazing artists who are reaching out to me to get info on getting a PhD. Everyone is feeling like they need to up their game! I think its going to be absurd in another 10 years what it will take to get a faculty position. And it will probably pay less than it Does now. I am kind of frustrated by the academy...but I also love the work. Guessing you feel similar.

Best of luck!

I still mean to visit you all when I next come to Santa Cruz. I havent been there in well over a year. Crazy.

All that's good,","Thanks for offering to serve as a reference. I think it is unlikely I will get a second round interview, but here’s hoping.

I do have a lot of frustration with the Academy, but after teaching at CSUMB and being more involved in the department, I can sense the tremendous difference when I walk onto the UCSC campus. At CSUMB, the vibe it’s all about applicable skills to get a job (a completely reasonable concern for most students), and teaching there feels like a job, a bit of a slog. 

In contrast, at UCSC it’s all about ideas. Despite my complaints and disappointments with the University sometimes, really, there are still people doing remarkable work within the walls of the Academy. You and I can both name 10 people at UCSC doing amazing work and challenging dominant ideas.

You are right that an all-white Faculty Does not say great things about the Department. in recent years the hiring of Jamin and Enrique were good moves. 

The thing is, you and I are not focused on doing work that will get us a university tenure job, but just trying to do good work. If we end up with a university tenure position, that’s great, but not our goal. I just want to do great art and a university TT position would facilitate that  

Where was it you applied? Clearly, they didn’t know what they were missing nor selecting you!

You are always welcome to visit us and we would love your company. you are welcome to stay in the Shantyboat when you come."

Please only share with people you like/respect/trust. Thanks!
I am looking for an internship/apprenticeship-type thing where I can help
out and work on a project for some of the summer. I am primarily looking
for physical work (ie not at the computer), but within that I am open to
almost anything. I could learn from a carpenter, electrician, mechanic,
welder, farmer, or someone else. I am a mature 14-year-old, a fast and
eager learner, and a hard worker. I enjoy both math and science in school,
and I also love working with my hands. The hands-on experience I have is
that for the past two summers I lived on an off-grid animal farm where I
learned a lot. I milked goats and sheep, moved fences, helped fix machines,
processed poultry, and helped build both a dairy room and a steel building.
I can be available as early as Memorial Day weekend all the way to July
15th. The areas where I could be based include Santa Cruz, CA, Minneapolis,
MN, and Columbus, OH.
If you know of something in one of these places, or someone who is looking
for help like this for the summer, please let me know. ","I'm excited about the possibilities of you having an internship or
apprenticeship building something. We haven't been doing much building
lately. (Remember when you helped with the boat?), but we will be working
on an art project this summer that will involve a lot of physical building
and construction. Want us to keep you informed when we are doing that?
Here's the project: https://blackrocktrainstation.com/"
, Thank you ,"Thank YOU for your support of the project. Since the bandanas and patches became available, we’ve added a couple new things:
Set of 6 black rock station postcards,
The original red Camp Blarg Playa Pilots, and
New train smoke and gold Playa Pilots
So that gives you new cool things to ponder."

I had a videographer who was all in... until he found he couldn't fly his
drone during the event. Sigh."
,"if someone is available
and interested they'll contact you.",Thanks.
,"WVOE was received and sent to Underwriter to be reviewed
I can give more info once we can get that cleared","Our conversation was so quick, I didn't completely understand what you did
to stop the clock or where we are at. Your further explanation would be
welcome.

Some items appeared on my To Do list. Should I go ahead and do those?"
,"Hope you are all doing well. I'm reaching out to you, Pip, since you are closer to the container in Nevada. Do you have the ability to help getting rid of broken things inside our Camp Blarg container? Dill has offered her help as she will be in that area in May. I wanted to connect all three of you because Rico also knows what to dump and what to keep. Rico also knows the location, if I'm correct in what I heard during a recent meeting. 

Please let us know what you think you can do and when. I can also reach out to Sam to see if she could help with this as I believe she's still in the Reno and Lake Tahoe area. ","Here are some initial thoughts in an enumerated list for your convenience:

I’ve heard from the container people that the container in inaccessible when not on the Playa. 
I would feel a little nervous about having folks attempt to purge things without necessarily knowing what is what. (For instance, did you know there is a pack of stuff for Arthur coming from New Zealand that’s been there for a decade and used when he comes? He’s coming this year, looks like.)
To do a purge, one would have to basically unload the entire container since is Tetris AF in there. 
More to the point, I was part of a huge and extremely thorough purge of all broken, unused, or questionably necessary items as recently as 2018 just hours before the container was repacked at the end of the event.
I’ve heard a few container myths going around, I’d like to address:  

The container is full of broken and unneeded stuff: I don’t think there is much in there at the moment that is unnecessary, unneeded, or broken. 

We are out of space in the container: there is usually a some room in our well-packed container, not a lot, but everything fits pretty well. 

The container is fucked and needs replacement: the shippers accidentally speared a hole in it, but have offered to fix it as soon as we get it on Playa. Otherwise, our old container is lovely. 

So it is completely possible there is nothing left to do other than have it delivered in August and judiciously pack it at the end of the event keeping our eyes peeled for things we can cull. 

I do think it would be cool to paint the Camp Blarg logo in 6 foot letters across both sides of our container. "

(too many reasons to list, but lots going on in my world). What about the
part time DM20 class? Did Wendy ever talk to you and Audrey about it?
I think for the full time job, they’re looking for someone strong in

Anyway, maybe there’s still a shot? And maybe at least adding you to the
web adjuncts would be so great.

unsure of my place in the world.

either Audrey or Wendy. I haven't followed up because I am swimming like
hell to keep my head above water this term with 4 classes at CSUMB and 2 at
UCSC.

August 28- September 5 is the opening to the closing for the event
September 5-6 is the teardown.

,"Letw see what i can do tomorrow. I'll try 13 waps,10 on Monday, 3 more on
Wednesday",Were you successful in your ask?
,"Thanks again for the good first call! I want to give you some more updates
on a few things:
- The *Honoraria contract *is almost ready to go. I wanted to check in
with you about early arrival:
My suggested date arrival date for your crew is: 8/22/22
We have 11 Work Access Passes and right now, my plan is to give you:
- 8x for 8/22/22
- 3x for 8/24/22
Let me know ASAP if you're ok with that!
Also, a reminder that I need the *contract contact details* from you (see
my last mail)!
- You should get the *first payment* of 55% 1-2 weeks after signing the
contract.
- In general, the best way of *finding information* regarding your art
installation is by looking into the Artist Handbook
<http://bit.ly/BManArtistHandbook>. I'd very much suggest that you and
your project leads are going through this as well as the Honoraria Artist
Addendum <http://bit.ly/HonorariumAddendum>.
- Once contracts, payments, and camp stuff are done, we will start looking
into some other issues:
-- one is the *engineering review* which we will start in mid-April,
where we will look more specifically at your engineering drawings
(especially anchoring and other safety issues). I would expect your piece
to be reviewed relatively late as it's quite straightforward.
- and then we will also look into* other resources that you might need* to
order in the next month (fuel, water, ...)
- As I mentioned in our meeting, we are currently planning to have the *Desert
Arts Preview* at either end of May or the beginning of June. Usually,
this is an in-person event in San Francisco, where 5-10 artists hold short
presentations but this year, again, we will do it *virtually*. If you
check *Burning Man's Youtube* channel, you can find both, videos of the
in-person as well as the virtual version from the last years. Let me know
if you are interested in presenting your installation there too. I can not
promise that you will be picked as one of the presenters but I'll do my
best.
- Also, I am really trying to include a *virtual tour through BRCvr
<https://brcvr.org/>* into the Desert Arts Preview in order to give
people a chance to see some more art. As I mentioned before, I would highly
suggest you look into *getting a 3d model of your art *that could be
included. Now is a good time to find volunteers who might be able to help
with that too. Having a 3d model might also be a really good way to have
something exciting to show for all your fundraising efforts. I will send
you an update once we have a better idea of what is planned and how it's
set up. If you already have a virtual model of your piece in BRCvr, please,
let me know!
- Lastly, *social media*: Feel free to send me your updates and I am more
than happy to share them internally and externally. I will also try to get
our Comms department to share things but that is rather hard tbh. The
better the photos, the easier it is. Also, if you haven't, please let me
know if you do any *fundraisers*, or if you need *volunteers *and *where
you are building your piece*, I'll be happy to share this too as much as
I can.
That's it for right now.
Please, feel free to contact me if I can support you in any way!
Kind regards!","We were planning to have 10 on-site on 8/22 which would be preferable.

I'm working on another Honoraria project that is in the final weeks of
fundraising - it's called INCENTER
<https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/incenter-burning-man-2022/x/13949090#/>
and is an art piece we're building to acknowledge and recognize the
pandemic and the global trauma that we've all been through together in the
last few years, together.
This is my third project with the lead artist and we're finding it a bit
harder this year to fundraise, so we would appreciate it so much if you
were willing to share our link with your camp and community :) Our
Instagram page is here <https://www.instagram.com/incenter.playa/> as
well.
Thank you and dusty hugs","I just saw your video when is beautiful and meaningful. I'll spread the
word about your fundraising!"
,"Ah, sorry I didn't see this last night. Tomorrow's fully booked for me, but Thursday can work most any time. Any window in there?

I think the first of the whistle blowouts was a different file than the one labeled with it (I pulled that part out of the file name there), but yeah, there were two where the whistles saturated things (mic or pre, but hard to know which). However, I think it sounds fine. It needed a couple extra steps to get overall levels to work, but they picked up mostly pretty analog distortion that Doesn't sound too bad to me in that context. See what you think.

And same on the one VTA stereo mockup - if you think it sounds viable, I can try that with the others in that set.","So Friday morning is when we start loading the trailer, so Thursday is the absolute last day to make any changes. 

At this point we will have to prioritize your time, I think. 

So the only things we’re missing are steam freight, electric freight, and electric passenger stop. 

I’d love to meet with you sooner than later to talk about how we can make the freight recordings."
,"28 - 34 are up in the Drive review folder. 

Bad news on 22 - 27, I'm afraid. All of those only have one channel with content. The first channel in every case is essentially a blank file. There's some steady noise when I crank it all the way up, but that's device self-noise as far as I can tell. I uploaded a version of 22 where I've used some tricks to recreate a sense of an L and R and associated motion. Take a listen and see if you think that's viable. It's definitely not the same as the real thing.

For the remaining things that need to be grafted, do you want to jump on Zoom some time this week so I can work on those with your feedback in real time? I'm not sure I'm 100% getting the plan from the descriptions, and I could use your ears to tell me if the hacks actually sound realistic. I know you're super busy this week esp., though - no worries if it's not feasible.","How about tomorrow morning? Anytime after nine I am available.

Yeah, if we had to lose a set, those particular VTA recording was probably the one to lose. It was plagued by external noises.

Glad the ones at Railtown worked out, because there was quite a bit of effort to get them. I drove six hours round trip to get the recording the first time and they forgot to tell me that steam wasn’t running that weekend and another six hours round-trip for the second recording. Curious, for the ones that I thought the whistle blew out the sound, 30 and 33, did they?"
,"
Thanks - I hadn't seen that email from Thursday with the other VTA ones. I'll see what I can do there, too. That Does mean it's a few more recordings than I was thinking for today, but I think there should be time for all. If not, I do have some windows tomorrow for wrapping up. So, shouldn't be too long in any case.

I can revisit the Boom library for potential materials for grafting with the freight options, too.",Thanks Larnie. I’m excited to see what you come up with. Maybe prioritize the steam stuff if you have to choose.

it may be a keeper, but tell me what you think after an initial listen.

The speeder recordings turned out awesome, and the young railroad worker
Charlie was happy to take me over several miles of track to find the ideal
quiet location. These are 2066 pirate speeders when no official locomotives
are running. Here's a video:

-Otherwise, everything is L2R now, and there are quieter versions of the VTA ones up. Ready to revise as needed, but I think this set is good to go.","That’s exciting. I’ll check them out including 9 and 14. I am unsurprised because I thought there were some that probably wouldn’t work.

,"Gotcha. Keep me posted on the full test.
I can swap the directions easy enough. I was misinterpreting your notes
from before to mean that would happen in the implementation, but yeah,
probably easier on my end.
Should have the best batch tomorrow night.","We prep the recordngs so everything is moving left to right.

Then if we have an Eastbound train, we leave it.

If we have a Westbound train, I swap channels on the fly."
,"Lots of things the crunchiness could be - definitely different playback
devices are going to respond to stuff this loud a bit differently, and most
laptop headphones amps aren't anything too fancy. That said, definitely
could be some of the artifacts from the limiting, though I wouldn't have
described it as crunchy on my monitors. If you can listen on another few
playback devices, that'll be the best test.
Yeah, I wondered about the electric. I can just pull those files down a
few -dB and reupload. I can keep the speeders quieter, too.
No LR swap - should be as they came in and as file names indicate. Did
one/some of them seem different than that?
You asked in the last email about trimming. I am cleaning up starts and
stops, though I'm also trying to do that pretty gently both to make sure I
don't lose any super distant stuff but also to facilitate very gradual fade
ins and outs - hoping that'll mean nobody really notices that something has
suddenly started coming out of the speakers. So, footsteps or handling
noises or anything totally superfluous goes, but there's usually at least
10-15 seconds of fade tim on each end, too. Does that work well for you?","Okay, we'll assume the crunchiness is my laptop and headphones. I can try
soon on the actual speakers with my high-end DAC.

Thanks for bringing down the electric and speeders.

Ultimately everything SHOULD be L to R, so all RL SHOULD be swapped.

Okay, it sounds like we are on the same page with trimming. I start the
recording at an arbitrary point at the first hint of a train and stop when
the background noise seems louder than the departing train. Feel free to
remove anything that has no train sounds at the beginning and end.

So here's what's remaining:

   - Maybe better freight recordings not damaged by the wind
   - Steam passenger through trains
   - Steam passenger stop
   - Pirate speeders

Thanks"
,"First half up for review now in the relevant folder. All retain the names
with ""edit"" appended. This includes loudness revision on the two from
before as well as some wind reduction work on that ""mixed consist"" one from
before, and then I've got up through the 8th file in the folder.
Most of the work on these is just getting those levels, editing out the
noises I think are undesirable, and trying to make clean transitions. The
little bit of width sweetening is still in there, too.
Loudness-wise, I'm pushing these to short term loudness measurements of
around -8 LUFS when the train is right there. For reference, broadcast
standards set a max of -18 LUFS for short term loudness, so these should be
pretty genuinely loud. Peaks hit -1.0 dBFS in all cases. For me, these
still sound loud on my headphones with the headphone amp only about a 1/4
up. So, I think they'll blast pretty easily through the big system.
For some context there, there are mostly just two ways of getting things
louder in a digital file. The first is raising the peak to the digital
ceiling (functionally, that's the -1.0 dBFS - we'd probably be ok, pushing
that up, but leaving 1 dB of headroom is the standard for almost every
application - and an extra dB isn't really perceptible to most people). The
second is increasing the average level, which is more in line with how we
perceive loudness. So, that either means raising all the quieter bits
(upward compression - less helpful for us) or pushing more of the loud bits
up against the peak (limiting - which Does help us make the loudest parts
sound loudest). That said, the trick is limiting transparently. So, when
you're listening, see if you feel like you hear that limiting happening.
Hopefully I haven't primed you to hear that, and I do think it's pretty
transparent - but, in any case, that's our tradeoff for getting louder.
Should I roll ahead with the rest of this batch or give you a chance to
listen a bit first? If these versions are working well, there's enough
shared about the process that it shouldn't take me too long with future
files.
Thanks for patience with all the steps here. And nice work on the
recordings - lots of good stuff in these!","Just listening to the edited recordings. Here are some observations:

Yes, they are indeed nice and loud. Did I hear some ""crunchiness"" at the
top end? Or Does that depend on my laptop and headphones?

The SJ VTA should probably not be quite as loud since it is electric. I
haven't recorded it yet, but when I record the little speeders (2066
Pirates using the rails) they will also be a bit quieter.

Did you swap channels to make everything L2R?"
,"Sounds good. I can dive in on these soon.

Re: louder - are you looking for louder in total or the quiet parts louder or something else? I can definitely go louder in any respect, though I'm conscious of not losing too much of the natural dynamic contrast (unless that's wanted). Ultimately, how much the PA is up will have more to do with the loudness than the extra I can get, so I want to make sure what we lose is worth the gain.

I'll go back on the ""mixed consist"" before for edits, and let me push volume on that and ""stack"" first to establish a target level to apply to the new ones.",On Saturday I am going to Stockton to record special steam trains.

But I will leave interpreting that to you.  In general, and I want is naturalistic a sound as possible, a simulation of standing next to a moving railroad train.

I listened to the raw recordings I made at 50% to 60% with headphones and they seemed quiet with my player and my laptop at full volume.  I just want to make sure that we are not in a position where the recording is so low that when we turn it up to achieve realistic volumes we don’t start hearing the ambient buzz of the equipment. That probably just reveals my ignorance of how everything works, so happy to leave this to the professionals (you).

Feel free to explain any of the audio concepts to me like I’m five if you have the patience. I learn a lot from my discussions with you."
,"Finally, I have some actual field recordings. Here is the link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_4GZj1C4iSlC9NISzTQxtWozfdbm5cEd?usp=sharing
There are two here:
   1. Diesel through freight, stack train, moving L to R, recorded at 50%
   trim
   2. Diesel through freight, mixed consist, moving L to R, recorded at
   60% trim
The 60% trim Doesn't feel like it came close to clipping. I might inch
that up a little bit next time.
Are these useful? If so, this is an opportunity to take these field
recordings and turn them into our first usable final cut.
What improvements for next time can you suggest? I'm probably going to be
doing another field recording next week, so your suggestions would be
helpful sooner than later.","I had an outing on Monday and recorded a whole bunch of recordings for you
to play with! The levels on all of them seemed good. Here's a key to my
filenames:

Key to filenaming comventions

num = the leading number is the sequence of recording I made
diesel is a diesel-electric locomotive
pass v. freight = passenger train v. freight train
stop v. thru = stops at station or continues through without stopping
fwd v. rev = sometimes short trains run with the locomotives pushing rather
than pulling, this is reverse rather than forward
L2R v. R2L = left to right vs right to left, in our recordings all channels
should be arranged so all trains L2R (and labeled as such)
w horn, bells, or announcements = additional things on the recording
V55 = volume trim was set to 55%
pref = this seems like it will be a particularly good recording
edit = add this to the end of a file you've edited

Note above that we will swap channels for any recording that is R2L to make
it L2R

Let's normalize and increase the volume of these recording so they sound
much louder in playback.

Lemme know when you have some recordings for me to review.

Thanks again."
,"Sorry, I didn’t see this message when I responded to your other one.
Thanks for all the feedback let me work through answers:
A stack train is a train that has mostly stacked containers. In general
the cars are better maintained and so quieter and there is less variety in
terms of the cars that go by. Mixed consist means literally that the train
consists of cars that are of mixed tape, it’s also called a junk train
because it makes more stops to drop stuff off and the cars in general are
less well maintained and so sonically much noisier and more interesting.
so I won’t go higher than 60% and can even dial it down to what I estimate
is 55%. I don’t remember the trains being particularly different in volume
and you can experience the substantial difference between 50% and 60% when
messing with the trim.
I was not stoked about the wind which picked up between the first and
second train a little bit. I have a note to myself to try to record early
in the morning when the winds are usually calmer. If possible, I’d like to
drop them out of the recording. I think it would sound strange to have one
noise coming from the speaker boxes.
I do want the trains to sound as loud as possible while still keeping all
the dynamics that we like.
Let’s drop the final recordings down to 24-bit. That will decrease file
size and will minimize any problems with my output hardware and software.
I haven’t listen to the processed versions yet and I’m excited to do that
tomorrow.
Thanks again for your help with this. Super fun. I can’t wait to record
more for you to play with.","These sound great.

Yeah, the wind on the ""mixed consist"" 60% recording is a little irritating.
Perhaps we can drop out the early and late audio, leaving just the distant
horns? Or we can drop out the early and late sound until we can
definitively hear the train, and then just add a distant train horn 4 or 5
seconds out from the train sounds at the beginning and the end. The horn
happens just before they hit a crossing.

I ordered a couple ""deadcat"" wind baffles that will help with the next
field recording.

I can hear a little crunchiness on the 60% recording, so I will definitely
trim down to what I estimate is 55%.

These are both useable. The ""stack train"" recording is great as is.The
""mixed consist"" maybe needs a little work.

Great job!"
,"Promising - can you tell me more about what ""stack train"" and ""mixed consistency"" mean? I'm assuming that's about what's behind the engine, right?

The 60% trim one Does get well above 0.0 dB, though the 32-bit seems to safely bail us out for digital clipping there. Again though, 32-bit is safe on the digital end, but the analog components before the signal is converted can still distort at high levels. Some of that isn't controllable (mics have max dB SPL that's just about the sound hitting them), but the analog components in and behind that first gain stage distorting would be dependent on levels. I'm not really hearing anything that seems problematic in that regard, but it's a reason not to go up further. We don't need more - and if you want louder, that would really be about using compression/limiting to increase average levels (which is what generates our perceptions of loudness) instead of higher peaks.

50% Does seem quiet, though I'm surprise there's that much difference between 50 and 60 there. Did that train sound a lot quieter when it went by?

How do you feel about the wind on the 60 one? (I think that's what that is in spots before and after the train - Doesn't seem isolated toward the side of arrival like I'd expect from train rumble.) It Doesn't bother me, personally, but if you really wanted to aim for 100% train only out of the speakers I can see how that might be suboptimal.

The R to L movement seems pretty distinct to me, which is good. Overall, for sure, I'd want to trust your ears here, too, since you've got the first-person experience of how close these come. I'll do some processing, and see what you think.

One question I don't think we covered yet - do you want to stay at 32-bit for final versions, too? Once I'm working in the box, it's easy enough for me to get levels set so we don't have to worry about any clipping. We'd get smaller files at 24 bits if storage is a concern. If not though, no real reason to do the extra conversion.","Sorry, I didn’t see this message when I responded to your other one. Thanks for all the feedback let me work through answers:

,"Processed versions of both uploading as I write (should be there by the time I'm done). I put them in the ""final"" folder to distinguish them, but do you want an intermediate stage there for stuff that's waiting for your review?

Processing is the same as we did last time: a little extra widening to try to expand the sense of motion and width and then some levels work both to keep the recordings in the same ballpark for loudness and to bring out a little detail. See if that's all still working well for you. I'm a little on the fence - hearing the processing on the louder parts more with these, though could be oversensitive to that.","A Waiting for my review folder is a great idea. 

How was it processing the beginning and tail end?

Can’t wait to review them.

,"We’d like to offer you access to purchase tickets to Burning Man via the Stewards sale. This is in addition to the gift tickets we will be giving you for your core crew to assist with your art installation as a 2022 Black Rock City Honorarium project. 

The suggested use for these tickets, if you choose to take part in the sale, is to assist members of your group of artistic collaborators who may not qualify for your art project’s core crew (for example: kitchen/camp crew, part-time crew, photographers/documentarians, other people you may want with you in Black Rock City but who aren’t the full-time core crew of your project.)

We are offering you access to purchase up to 4 tickets at $475 each (they only come in pairs, so your choices are 2 or 4 tickets). You don’t have to buy the tickets yourself, you’re just the point person. You’ll have to go online between Feb 23 and March 4 (see schedule below) and assign them out in pairs to the intended recipients, with their Burner Profile email address. 

I need your response by 10am Pacific time on Monday, February 14th with the number of tickets you want access to purchase. (If you don’t want access, you don’t need to respond.)

More info about the sale, including the dates, below.

","You may not yet be able to answer this, but it will guide us in the Stewards sale  the question is this: earlier we were offered free tickets for our core crew and half price tickets for our support crew. Is that still a thing?"

,"We hope you are all doing well and managing to stay healthy as we kick off
a new year. While we’re all looking forward to making Black Rock City
happen in 2022, the folks at Burning Man Project have been working on
creating a maker space and community with useful facilities in Gerlach, and
we need your input.
Are you interested in reserving storage space and other support services?
If so, we want your help!
You may have heard
<https://journal.burningman.org/2021/08/global-network/rhymes-with-burning-man/if-you-build-it-they-will-come/>
about some of our efforts to further develop Burning Man Project’s
properties in and around Gerlach. One of the projects underway is the
creation of a space that would give Burners the ability to store property
and work on projects year-round and closer to the Black Rock Desert than
most, if not all, other options. This could include expanded access to
the BRC Storage Program <https://storage.burningman.org/>, with potential
new options like storage for trailers, artwork and mutant vehicles. We are
also considering introducing access to camping/RV facilities and common
shops.
We’ve created a short survey to gauge interest levels, and learn what
aspects of a storage and workshop offering are most interesting to you. We
hope to begin offering opportunities to reserve storage space in early
2022; please take time to help us understand what the right opportunity for
you would look like!
To participate in the survey, please go to the following link:
https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6708475/2022-Storage-Survey
The survey will be open until 11:59 PM Pacific time, Sunday, February 13th.
If you have any questions about the survey, please email
brcstorage@burningman.org.
We look forward to hearing from you.","BRS might be able to use storage between 2022 and 2023. That would be huge.
It would answer the question: WTF are we gonna do with this thing in the
short run?

How about Camp Blarg? It would be nice to have a cheaper option to store the
container, but having a full service pick-up and drop-off thing is
certainly helpful. What do y'all think?

I'll hold off answering this RE BRS until I hear from you guys about your
thoughts about how if at all Camp Blarg can use this opportunity.

When we get our placement questionnaire, it seems like you were shepherding
the placement process already. Do you want me to do it? Do you want to do
it? Do you need my help? Jan wisely suggested that we also tell placement
that we are an art support camp for BRS and will need space for trucks,
trailers, and some materials."

We were looking for opportunities to collaborate with other interactive
camps and art pieces. At Black Rock Station last year, we were taken by
surprise how much visitors were obsessed with the station as a puzzle box.
So this year we decided to lean into it and make the station more of a
puzzle. One idea we had was to collaborate with other camps and art
projects to scatter clues or swag or something. We'd love to hear your

Electricity and water are nice. Most places I’ve looked at have electricity, though more remote places obviously don’t have city water. I’ll say that those things are nice, but not critical and may be outweighed by other things.

We are artist, and so we picture a place where we can have some rusty vehicles and building saovage that we are working with. The places in the neighborhoods with nicer homes probably wouldn’t be that patient with a house that looked trashy by conventional standards. I’ll bet that is not a typical real estate request."

Hi everybody,

By now you'll have all seen the news about the strike.  It's a lot to digest, especially for our members who have not been as involved in the day to day movements. Please reach out to them and encourage them to come to the town halls on Monday and sign up for picket shifts. If you haven't signed up yet, please sign up for picket shifts here. 

We're still trying to get a few more strike commits today, so if you can phonebank or reach out to uncommitted members that would be great.  Please be very careful to let them know that this is an Unfair Labor Practices (ULP) strike, especially in any written communication.  

As always, if you have questions/thoughts/concerns, I'm here :). See you on the picket,",I contacted the other art department lecturers and gave them simple clear instructions for what to do Wednesday and Thursday and invited them to join us on the picket.
,"Totally makes sense. Ideally before Thursday if you can!!
The large lectures will be finalized and posted on Thursday, and then
we'll be competing with others who are trying to make requests. So the
earlier, the better to give us our best chance of getting that room for all
8 discussion sections. However, the final deadline would be before the end
of the quarter.",What software did you use when you taught 4D Foundations?

meet and greet. It would be really great having you in there too! And it's
really easy to show your art in 3D afterward to whomever you want to! The

tickets, rather than 2. Everything else looks fine.

,"Well, I got some shitty news.
My new sailboat isn't going to make it down to Florida/Bahamas this winter. 

I had to get back to Florida for work before I was able to fix the boat, fortunately I was lucky enough to have an amazing crew of boat punks who were willing to fix and then sail the boat to Florida in my absence. 
Evan, Joseph, Ally and Jason Flack went above and beyond to try and fix the boat before the onset of winter and sail it down to Florida. 
Everything was looking good and the boat was launched with very little time to spare for making the journey down to Florida. Once the boat was in the water a leaky hull fitting was discovered that necessitated hauling the boat out of the water to repair. There wasn't enough time left and the crew was forced to abandon ship. 
I looked into other options to get the boat down here but in the end I couldn't find any reasonable way of doing it.

At this point I'm probably not going to go to the Bahamas at all this March, I'm juggling too many things right now and it's really killing my joie de vivre.

I'm not sure what the future of this sailboat is but I'll probably sell it unless there's enough interest from folks to make a plan to have a serious sailing adventure this summer. 
Hit me up if you're interested or have some ideas.

If you are still interested in the AYC meet up this March let me know and I can put you on the signal thread. Folks are still hammering out the details and just starting to look into getting an Airbnb for the boatless.

fun adapting your painting to our poster. I say adapted because I took
liberties with the format and the saturation of the colors. I extended it
from a horizontal format to a vertical format by digitally extending both
the top and bottom of the image. At all times, I tried to maintain the
spirit of your painting, even borrowing textures from other paintings in
your series.

I would like to credit you in the painting. I could add your anglicized
name Linglei Lu, or I could add your name in simplified or traditional
Chinese (you'll have to tell me how to spell it in Chinese). I could do it
subtly in black as if painted on, or more obviously in white as if added to
the poster. Do you have a preference?

I think it turned out beautifully.  Your feedback is more than welcome.

,"The information and photos I checked at that time showed that the initial railway construction was mainly build by the laborer who were poor immigrants from Europe. The construction of the railway started from the eastern plains, and after entering the western mountainous areas, the project became more and more difficult, so the company began to recruit Chinese laborers from China. The railway construction of the section of the Rocky Mountains is dominated by Chinese laborers.

History paintings must respect historical facts, so there are Chinese and white workers in my paintings.

However, I really rarely see information about Black men participation in railway construction. You can try to find it online again.

I recommend you an article written by an American school teacher for the reference.

The poster idea is very good, go on.","I think you were right regarding the transcontinental railroad, but many of the regional railroads, particularly built throughout the south were built by enslaved African laborers. I heard it referenced recently in the 1619 Project published in the New York Times, and found it readily when I searched references just now:

https://railroads.unl.edu/blog/?p=32

It is an interesting part of history, but no surprise that the people doing the most dangerous, most grueling work were enslaved and free Africans-Americans, Chinese workers, poor people from Europe, native Americans, and many other marginalized people who had little control over their pay or labor conditions.

Another seldom told part of Railroad history are the caravans of women and girls assigned to follow the labor camps trafficked for the benefit of the men. 

I believe the traditional Chinese at the bottom of my sketch says “these workers built the railroad.”  I used Google translate, but it is notoriously comical sometimes when translating any but simple ideas. I wanted to check with you to see if it read right to your eyes or could be improved."
,"I am very happy to read your letter.
I fully support your idea. You can apply my work elements in your new
works. Hope to see your digital poster soon and the scene at the exhibition
in 2022.
Wish success!","Thank you for your blessing. That means a lot to me.

Another inspiration from whom I hope to borrow her minimalistic style is
Amber Share who did a great series on the U.S. National Parks. Here are
some examples of her work -- these include quotes from some visitors' Yelp
reviews of some of the national parks.

Here was my first sketch of the poster:

[image: IMG_0182.JPG]

Which brings up a question I have: I noticed that some of the laborers in
your paintings had dark skin and wore more American clothes, rather than
traditional Chinese clothing.
Were these intended to be Chinese men who had adopted Western wear, or were
they intended to be African-American men? Historically, Chinese laborers
and, before 1865, enslaved Black men throughout the American South,
constructed the railroads. If it was your intention to show Chinese and
Black laborers working together, I am doubly inspired by your art."
,Thanks Wes!,"I also forgot to say that I liked a lot what you said, Warren, about the
purpose of education It isn't training or acquisition of skills, but
learning how to think. of course, I was an undergrad at a liberal arts
university, so of course I'd say that.

That's something I've been thinking a lot about as try to articulate why
teaching at CalState Monterey Bay is so unsatisfying. The chair of my
computing and design department is proud of how a sizeable percentage is
reportedly able to get jobs in their field after they graduate. And I'm
sure the young people (majority BIPOC, particularly Latinx) who emerge into
our neo-liberal economy with few prospects are grateful too. And I
appreciate that. However, to me, that is not what a university education is
for. I think a focus on marketable and employable skills Does our graduates
a disservice. What happens when they change careers? Did we teach them how
to think? How to learn? How to be curious and questioning? I do my best in
my classes, but it isn't the focus of our department, or as far as I can
tell, our school. It is one of the reasons I have delayed joining our
department as tenure track faculty.

I didn't go to a CSU, so perhaps it was always like that. I don't know. But
according to contacts, that's the neoliberal direction their higher ed
institutions are moving.

Love to hear your thoughts about that."

," I'd probably be useful to talk about what things I'm looking for and we try to figure out how you could contribute within your time constraints and how or if we can make it work. My schedule is full this week as it's the last week of this stanford rehab program with ziva, but I think next week is way more open for me. What is your availability on Tuesday? ","Tuesday is a really good day for me next week, the last week I only have four classes and then after that have six classes for about a long grueling month."
,Let's talk about this. I think it's a real possibility. What are thinking in terms of time? Let's talk soon about it,"With building a big burning man art project this spring and summer, teaching six classes this spring, teaching six or more classes next year, about half of which I’ve never taught before, and maybe embarking on a special personal project that Blintz and I are considering, I suspect we will have more than enough to do. 

That said, I am interested in this project because you’re involved, I like the work you are doing, and, to be completely honest, I want to invest in a future where I work remotely and have a bit more freedom about where I’m spending time. 

So… what do you think is the minimum involvement for now that will keep my hand in, allow me to be paid, And still be useful? 

Like most smart people, I’ve found that I can do a standard eight hour day’s worth of work in about two hours, so perhaps half or quarter time would allow me to be useful and not be too stressful on my schedule. 

What are your thoughts?"
,Thank you for reaching out. I’ve asked our marketing communications team to research these details and try to track down info on these colors. The local manager is correct regarding our limited ability to donate paint due to supply chain challenges. When will you need paint for the project?,"Thank you for your letter and thank you for having your team look into the original color. Unsurprisingly, the original paint used white lead and some interesting pigments. See the photo below. Happily, we don’t need to be THAT authentic. 

The project won’t be installed until August 2022, but we wanted to experiment with Sherwin-Williams paint as soon as the weather got better. 

We are interested in trying to simulate exterior surface that may have not been painted for decades with both cracked and powdered/chalking surfaces. But these experiments don’t rely on having the precise coloration.

Realistically, we won’t be doing finish painting until spring 2022. We can keep in touch until then."
,"Thanks so much.  This really helps, and all your effort documenting
the design-build process is much appreciated.
I’ve got questions, and if you’d prefer I use your blog site to post them,
let me know.  Other than the barrel/pontoon raft, this would be my first
attempting at building a real boat with cabin.  I have some framing
experience and enjoy woodworking projects.
My questions:
1         Why go down into the hull with the cabin, other than the obvious
framing stability the hull sides provide (anti-racking)?  As an older guy,
I’d prefer to have a single level deck, both inside and outside of the
cabin.  This maintains my line of site and aids in window placement, and
would seem to make it easier to install the cabin to ¾” plywood decking.  I
would think 2x2 framing with a sole plate attached to the decking could be
made sufficiently stable when the walls are connected..  Perhaps the corner
studs could run through the deck and attach to lower stringers (see 2.
Below).??  I realize this raises the profile and is more subject to shore
and wind hazards, and perhaps that’s reason enough to sink the cabin.
2         In my head (and before I read all the tried and true hull
construction methods outlined in the several plans you linked), I
envisioned parallel ¾” plywood bulkheads or partitions running at right
angles to the skegs, 2’ to 3’ OC.  Three 2x6” skegs would partially be set
into these reinforced partition pockets in the bottom of the hull (each
side and center) and serve dual duty as skegs and framing stringers, with
parallel 2x4 stringers on the top sides and centers, again set into
reinforced pockets of the partitions.  Not at all sure if this is a
structurally sound method, and I’ve only begun to research this topic.
Additional stringers would be connected at right angles to the top side and
bottom skegs, similar to the corners of wall framing, but laid on its
side.  The partition type hull framing fastened by stringers and skegs
would then be skinned with 1/2” plywood (?), and completely covered on the
outside with fiberglass cloth, including the embedded skeg stringers.
3         Did you have to epoxy the interior of the hull also, and any
structural members touching/joining the interior bottom and sides of the
hull?
4.        Did you have to wait for each coat of epoxy to dry before
applying the next coat of either thinned or thickened epoxy?  Was the
thickened version used just to adhere or “glue” adjoining members?  Can I
use wood glue above the deck?
5.        Are you planning to paint the hull with marine grade paint?
6.        Are you concerned about water getting inti the bilge, and will
there be a pump to remove?
7.        What kind of trailer are you going to use.  I envision having to
modify a boat trailer or using a low-boy flat bed.
Thinking I could build the boat on the trailer, or transfer a completed
hull to trailer and then build the rest on top of it??
I apologize if this all sounds wacky, when there are already so many plans
out there.
Thanks for all your help!","I'll try to answer all of your questions below:

1. Why go down into the hull with the cabin, other than the obvious
framing stability the hull sides provide (anti-racking)?  As an older guy,
I’d prefer to have a single level deck, both inside and outside of the
cabin.  This maintains my line of site and aids in window placement, and
would seem to make it easier to install the cabin to ¾” plywood decking.  I
would think 2x2 framing with a sole plate attached to the decking could be

studs could run through the deck and attach to lower stringers (see 2.
Below).??  I realize this raises the profile and is more subject to shore
and wind hazards, and perhaps that’s reason enough to sink the cabin.

A couple of reasons: a) increased storage, including using the space under
the deck forward and aft, for water, propane, extra fuel, etc. b) increase
space in the cabin, giving us a cabin tall enough to easily stand in and
even put a sleeping loft in the gable. c) decreasing the height of the
cabin, as you mentioned, which decreases windage. D) most importantly, it
shifted the center of gravity downward, making the barge nearly impossible
to capsize.

As you can see from the outside of my boat, even though the inside of the
cabin is nearly 2 foot lower, the windows are well placed for visibility.
The cabin was built of 2x3s as recommended by Glen L Witt who created the
Waterlodge plans and wrote the bible on plywood boat building, called
(""Boatbuilding with Plywood"" https://www.amazon.com/Glen-L-Witt/e/B001KCN88S
).

2. In my head (and before I read all the tried and true hull
construction methods outlined in the several plans you linked), I
envisioned parallel ¾” plywood bulkheads or partitions running at right
angles to the skegs, 2’ to 3’ OC.  Three 2x6” skegs would partially be set
into these reinforced partition pockets in the bottom of the hull (each
side and center) and serve dual duty as skegs and framing stringers, with

side.  The partition type hull framing fastened by stringers and skegs
would then be skinned with 1/2” plywood (?), and completely covered on the
outside with fiberglass cloth, including the embedded skeg stringers.

I think we all have in our heads a skeleton of a boat that has ribs similar
to a whale or a dinosaur. I was also surprised to see the Watelodge plans
calling for stringers that ran from fore to aft. The designer was a naval
architect, which I definitely am not, so I was inclined to believe him when
he said that this was the preferred method. I'm pretty sure boats have been
built everywhere you can imagine. The way I figured it, is that a lifelong
boat designer and builder would have made a million little and big mistakes
over the life of their career. So if I had the opportunity to benefit from
their experience without having to make the same stupid mistakes, I'd be
that much ahead.

One good things about stringers vs. ribs, is that water spilled anywhere
goes all the way to back of the bilge where the pump is.

In the construction of the Watelodge, it was understood that at some point
the skegs may wear down and need replacement, so they are bolted into the
hull but not a structural part of it.



3. Did you have to epoxy the interior of the hull also, and any
structural members touching/joining the interior bottom and sides of the
hull?

I didn't want to encapsulate the interior of the hull with epoxy because I
wanted the interior to have the ability to dry if it got wet. It seemed
like a bad idea to encapsulate the plywood from the outside and the inside,
inevitably trapping water. Rather, I coated all of the interior hull parts
below the decks with copper green, then professional primer somewhat
thinned to soak in as much as possible, then with another layer of thicker
primer. That way, the interior hull would resist rot, yet dry as needed.

4. Did you have to wait for each coat of epoxy to dry before
applying the next coat of either thinned or thickened epoxy?  Was the
thickened version used just to adhere or “glue” adjoining members?  Can I
use wood glue above the deck?

Technically, epoxy ""sets"" rather than ""dries,"" a chemical reaction that
always stressed me out. I used 5:1 epoxy throughout. Glen-L has really good
deals on epoxy -- so much better than the gouging prices of West Marine or
your local boat store. Generally, yes, we let the previous layer of epoxy
set before adding the next layer. So here's a typical action plan for say
adhering two pars of a stringer together:

   1. Dry fit everything to check fit
   2. Get materials and tools ready
   3. Mix up small batch of regular 5:1 epoxy with no filler
   4. Apply to all surfaces that are going to be adhered (this keeps the
   dry wood from ""robbing"" the joint of epoxy)
   5. Let thin coat set
   6. Mix up larger batch of 5:1 epoxy with enough filler to have a
   consistency of (non-runny) peanut butter
   7. Apply thickened epoxy to both sides of joint
   8. Apply pieces of joint to each other, securing with screws (""glued and
   screwed"")
   9. Wipe off any extra peanut butter that squeezed out of your sandwich

I used Construction adhesive (like PL) for all the critical joints of the
cabin frame.

5. Are you planning to paint the hull with marine-grade paint?

I did indeed. Below the waterline I used ablative hull paint. Above I used
marine paint. For a few years, we just used varnish on the hull so you
could see the wood below, but it never looked as nice as the moment after
we varnished it.

6. Are you concerned about water getting into the bilge, and will
there be a pump to remove?

We have two bilge pumps and two bilge switches (in parallel so they serve
as backups). The switches only activate when the water is about a 1/2"" deep
which seems like a lot, so in the rare times we've had water in the bilge,
we've turned on the pump manually and then sponged the remainder out

7. What kind of trailer are you going to use.  I envision having to
modify a boat trailer or using a low-boy flatbed.

I was lucky enough to already own a burly double axel 20 ft flatbed. I was
worried about how the 8' wide boat would sit on a trailer with a 6' wide
bed. It turns out when the boat is sitting on blocks on the trailer to
accommodate the skegs, the hull is just above the wheels.

Hope all that helps."
,"Thanks Wes.  That is helpful.  I’d love to see some plans to see how the hull framing and bottom is constructed.  Is the bottom flat, or is a keel or skegs required to aid directional steerage.  The Ohio River is our destination.  What is the preferable hull construction, knowing that we will have to find and modify a boat trailer of flat bed trailer?  Doug fir framing and exterior plywood will be our materials.  I imagine the hull exterior (interior?) will need to be coated with fiberglass cloth and epoxy resin.
 
Thanks again for taking some time out of your busy schedule.","This should help. It shows the barge bottom boat, with the two skegs running most of the length of the boat, as well as other construction details. https://peoplesriverhistory.us/tag/boatbuilding/?order=asc"

Building a Shanty Boat

My friend & I built an 8' x12' raft with plywood over frame over 50 gal drums 2 years ago and floated some of the Ohio river SW of Cincinnati, down to Madison, IN. We want to build a larger version next year we can sleep on for a 1 to 2 weeks journey, perhaps 8' x 18' or so, with 2 small bunks, a table, maybe a small galley & composting toilet, with an open, covered rear deck. Thinking of a plywood, flat-bottomed hull (ribs?), but would like advise from an experienced builder on design and materials. Can I call you? Thanks,","I’ve spent a lot of time on crazy rafts built from scrap materials. In fact the one we built over and over again was 8x16, four sheets of plywood long with them oriented abeam. 

When we built the shantyboat, we built it adapting the hull plans for the Waterlodge 20 from Glen-L, a traditional barge with fiberglass over plywood. Take a look at those plans. I know several people who’ve built boats from those plans with success. 

https://www.glen-l.com/designs/hankinson/waterlodge.html

Unfortunately, building a hull rather than a raft will take a lot more time. I built mine over two years working nights and weekends.

on workload protections or wage increases. So despite the mood of adjuncts
systemwide being ready for labor action, UCOP has still not gotten serious.

has made us stronger. So we are thinking a two day strike Nov 17th and

require a letter, only a reference. So if you are willing, you need to do
nothing yet.

But if I am fortunate enough to be selected for a second-round than they
might ask for either a letter or a conversation."
,"Hey Josh,
That's awesome. Thank you. All my idols write books, but
officially artist-academics exhibit. Which I've done aplenty.
Tell me what you need to know.
I'll attach my CV, my teaching statement (though R1 schools care less
about teaching and more about research), and my statement of research. As
you glance through those, if you have any suggestions, I would be honored
to hear them.
What else? A link to the position itself:

Books are overrated. Maybe we should coauthor some article or something?
Any ideas?

,"Hey folks  - you signed up to help with outreach this week. We are going
to have phone banks every day 3-5 pm, would any of those days, or several
work for you? If not, what time would work?","Tuesday, Thursday, and Firday work for me."
,I've been asked to not have overlapping times for your time preferences for your two courses. Can you provide 2 additional times for me to include? ,"How about the next two Tuesday Thursday timeslots?

If you have to divvy them up between the two classes, maybe alternate them so there’s a chance they end up near each other on my calendar ?"
,"Fun talking to you yesterday. In my enthusiasm to share Winona/river stories, I forgot to ask a kind of basic question:

Where is it that you grew up? And is that the source of your love of rivers? Or did that start more with the punk rafting?
","Good question. Believe it or not I spent my early childhood in Southern California where the nearest river was a concrete aqueduct. Perhaps that is why when my grade school librarian gave me a copy of Kon Tiki it so fired my imagination. Soon after that I discovered Huck Finn and Farley Mowat. 

I read these adventure books and thought, “Exactly! Why shouldn’t my life be this full of adventure and meaning?”

I lay how my life turned out squarely at the feet of my fifth grade librarian."
,"That should work. I have another interview at 11:30 central, so if  I don't answer right away, I may still be in that, but I will call you back.  What number will you be calling from? Or do you want me to call you?

How about 10:30 my time. I know that’s no longer morning for you, but I hope that works.","If you like we could Skype or zoom.  It if not, I’ll be happy to call. Mine is 831-419-0044"
,"Let's shoot for Thursday morning, if that works. I'm on central time, obviously, but happy to talk whenever. 

Look forward to it!","How about 10:30 my time. I know that’s no longer morning for you, but I hope that works."
,"Thanks for the note.  Good to know all this.
Not sure what kind of story it might be, but probably not a sports/travel
story. Probably more profile/history or something along those lines. Maybe
with a little first person, being sort of a river person myself. Not sure,
but I'd love to chat about it and just see what the possibilities are. Are
you around later this week, or early next?","Later this week is good. Maybe Tue, Thu, or Fri morning?"
,"I'm a writer in Minneapolis, and just came across your project. I grew up in Winona, and am really interested in this, but I couldn't quite figure out if these is some video or book forthcoming? It looks like there was some motoring on the river in 2021?

If you have a timeline, or possible timeline, I'd love to thing about possible stories on the project.

Thanks much, and I'll look forward to hearing from you.","Thanks for troubleshooting my website. I fixed it. 

I’m glad you found the project. I was in Mpls and Winona in 2015 and we loved it. We’ve wanted to visit our friends in Winona again for a while. 

Since we were on the Upper Mississippi, we’ve been on the Tennessee, Sacramento, Hudson, and Ohio Rivers over the last seven years, with the last river being the Ohio River in 2019 before the pandemic. 

Our next river will be the Atchafalaya River and it’s neighboring bayous in 2023. 

The project has a number of outcomes: an extensive blog, an interview archive, short and feature documentaries, and a book that I am currently writing. 

As people everywhere, not just on the coast but in river communities, respond to the effects of global climate change, as people deal with the real affects of economic displacement, and as people try to hold on to some authenticity and culture in their communities, these stories are important touchstones. The project is topical because river culture — and by extension any authentic American culture — is endangered. 

It is also topical because when we look at the threats to river culture and economic displacement,  there is a racial and economic dimension to decisions around river development and protection.

I’d love to talk to you about this and about your work when you get a chance. Where is this as a sport related or travel story, or something else?"
,"I am showing an order for Christine Brooks (2 patches, 2 bandanas) sent 12/7/21.
Those other names are not found on the sheet.",Hmm. I’ll swe if I can find them somewhere or write her back. Unless you want to write her back and see how she ordered stuff for those people.
,What are your plans for Dotty and the project in 2022? I'd like to cross paths.,In 2022 we’re going to take another year off so I can continue to write my book. But in 2023 we are headed for the Atchafalaya river in Louisiana.
,"I am going to be sending an update to the whole unit shortly; long story short, we won what we were asking for in the Writing program but the University  only agreed to keep discussing Music and Languages.  The WP thing is HUGE but we are going to have to keep organizing around Music to get the workload reduction the lecturers there are after.  I think it is actually a really winnable campaign but we aren't quite to the finish line yet.  
Stay tuned for a fuller update,","Okay, thanks. Let’s keep drumming home that we don’t want to leave SOME of us behind. Harm to one is harm to all!"
,Can Rhizome  and i get WAP for Tuesday?,"Thanks for working on paper tickets. It should be easier this time, because
I will be holding all the unallocated Early Crew tickets."
,"We're awash in yummy treats these days, but I'll take a raincheck on that!
Also, we could hang out and eat said treats together, maybe!
Also, we still have your shirt. 
Also, how's teaching going?","Teaching is bizzy. I’ve become obsessed with programming for the Black Rock Station. Does Mikey like programming? Does he ever talk about it?

Yes! Snax together!"
,"Attached is our finalized agenda for tomorrow (the minutes I sent last email are unchanged) and here's our link for tomorrow's DM Advisory meeting:
https://cccconfer.zoom.us/j/94743327654

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Wendy and I are looking forward to seeing you then!","Thanks, Julia!"
,"Yeah, happy to fill this in officially. I know we talked about this a bit before. 

I'm not going to be there in person. While we don't have the finalized 2022-2023 academic calendar yet, I don't think we've ever started late enough that this wouldn't overlap at least the first week of classes (and might be even more).

So, I don't think that's a surprise, right, but is it workable for you to not have dedicated audio help on site?","In the past, I’ve come back for the first day of class and then done the second one asynchronously. This year, I think I’m just gonna start my classes asynchronously.

I’m happy to have your help in whatever form you love to offer it. Though, it’ll be so fun to be in the desert with you, I will miss you if you’re not there."
,"Wow! They all look great. 

We started working off your original picture and then had to pull another that had a brighter sky. Take a look at the mock up attached. Can we use that picture to launch?

As soon as you agree, or make adjustments/additions to our agreement I'll get the labels printed and we'll soft launch. I would like to do something in the spring for an official launch. I'll keep you informed as to progress. I'd like to be able to get everybody together on the river for an event and launch into 2022!
<image.png>
<image.png>","Those look great. You have my thumbs up. 

If you want to book me for a talk in conjunction with the soft and hard launch that would be fun, particularly if it is promoted in conjunction with the river clean up non-profit. Usually I ask $250-500 for an hour talk."
,I sent the wrong version a minute ago. Take a look at this agreement. ,"This looks great, Jim. 

I’d like to say I didn’t forget about you, but in all the hullabaloo around all the classes I am teaching, I totally did. Apologies. I owed you an email with some image options.

Where are we at with the illustration?"
,"Do you have any sketches in the style of your comic? Originally, I was
thinking Dotty with the life buoy side towards camera lit by the light at
dusk. But, like the style of the comic art too. Do you have a couple works
already you can share? Then, we'll do a mock-up and send it back for you to
comment on?","I don't have any sketches of the shanty boat in the style of my comic,
though given a little bit of time, I could probably put something together.
Here is one of our favorite photos of the shanty boat which is similar to
how you described it. If
[image: 2016 07 storm looms over shantyboat - adrian nankivell.jpg]
I did a sketch, I would probably work from this."
,"If you would like to discuss let me know what time works for a phone
call. I'm sure I could figure out zoom, too.","I apologize that it has been hard to nail me down. I've been swamped with
the start of school and teaching.

First, I love the Missouri River. My very first river float was on the
Missouri River. I've enclosed a comic that I wrote and illustrated after
that experience. I've never been on the section near Richmond, though we
got as far as Kansas City. Sunshine Lake suggests that the river was once
much closer to Richmond.

I'm a big fan of good whiskey. It is what fuels our adventures and
fieldwork on American rivers! It looks like you are producing spirits (from
apples?) to Switch Grass. I would be honored to have some of the whiskey to
which you have contributed on board the shantyboat Dotty next time we do
fieldwork.

I think it is awesome that you are committing to contribute some of your
profits to Missouri River Relief. I've run into Chad Pregracke of Living
Lands & Waters on the Tenneessee, the Mississippi, and the Ohio Rivers.
Apparently he was instrumental in forming Missouri River Relief (
https://riverrelief.org/about/our-history/).

I would be honored if you used an image of Dotty for your labels. With your
work with MRR, it seems appropriate. Perhaps a donation to the Secret
History project and a case of whiskey would be a great way to help us out.

What form would you like to use an image of Dotty? Do you need photos? I've
made occasional sketches, but I'm not sure what you envision."
,"We've just begun to get to know the Missouri River even though I've lived with 10 miles of it nearly 57 years. Stumbled across your project and love the River Shanty. We're a small farm distillery collaborating with a distillery across the state. The connection, besides the product, is the river. I'd like to use an image of your shanty for our label. The idea is pay for image, and an amount per bottle would be donated to the Missouri River Relief-outreach, trash pickup, canoe race on the river.... If this might be of interest to you can we schedule a call that fits our schedules to discuss? ","Ignore my previous message. I misunderstood what you were hoping to do. We frequently get requests to put ads on our website. 

I like what you are trying to do and appreciate that you are donating to Mississippi river relief."
,"I am really so pleased to work on getting you what you need and want here. I obviously have no magic wand, I'll just fight the good fight! I will circle back with you and Audrey. I'm thinking even Wendy for our next Zoom. So me and wendy there for the first 10-15 mins and you and Audrey for another 15-30 mins, whatever feels good to you both to start envisioning the possibilities.

I'll be in touch (a LOT, sorry, there's also advisory nudges) very soon.",Me too! I’m so pleased at the opportunity to work with you.
,"Can you send me link again? Great to meet you and Emily and especially get
answers to stuff nobody has given me including history and confusion about
just generally how employment in academia via UC really works. I mean for
me still new to employment in higher education, this has been super
confusing!!!

,"Thank you for all the work you are doing on behalf of the Union and the members.  I will chat with my students about the classification of lecturers and what that means.

Hope you are having a good quarter.","Thanks, Katie. So far so good this quarter!"
,"We spoke on hear a while back and I'm just reaching out again to see if there is a time this week or next where we might be able to talk about ""The Secret History of River People,"" your journeys in the shanty boat, and the oral histories you collected.

And regarding the job-I’m not on the committee but I’d say throw in your
hat. You never know how these things will go.
Sending you all the best—will be a few weeks before I could get
together-maybe more like winter break-but I would love to do a mutual
interview.
hugs,","Thinking about the EASP Asst Prof position. From whom do you suggest I get
recommendations? I have other artist contacts, UCSC mentors, and museum
professionals, and a few artistic collaborators from other institutions.
Does the content of a rec even matter (assuming it's positive) or only the
status of their role?

What other pro-tips do you have for me? I know it's been a minute since you
applied for a prof job, but I figured you've served on your share of hiring
or review committees, as I have. But my experience at CSUMB, feels
non-transferrable -- we were only concerned with teaching. Research was
part of it, but only as a way of solidifying our understanding of their
expertise.

My dept at CSUMB has asked me to apply for a TT position when it comes up,
but I'm ambivalent. They rely on me to teach 4 important core classes and I
do a decent share of departmental work (unpaid, of course!) as their older
faculty creep toward retirement. While I love teaching, my practice is what
gets me fired up and gets me out of bed each morning. So a stable TT
position that didn't include my practice as part of my contribution would
be more of a job-job, than a dream job. So I've been looking at research
universities where I'd be expected to do the research I love. I just did an
artist talk at a museum in Princeton last night which was exciting."
,"Here are some images and credit lines for your presentation to include Hardenbergh images and information. If you would like more detailed info on Hardenbergh's life I can put you in touch with the author of the definitive book on him which was used in the creation of the exhibition.

Looking forward to seeing your powerpoint/presentation at least one week prior to the program so we can review.

Many thanks!","Thank you for getting the images and photo credits from Jesse. I haven’t yet looked at the folder, but based on Jesse‘s descriptions it sounds like it is photos and photo credits. 

I would still love to have The following, since it ties Hardenbergh’s‘s life and experience to both his naturalist work and my history of Shantyboating. 

>> A little history of what years he lived there
>> Anything he wrote about living on the boat or at Scow Ditch

So perhaps forwarding my request to Hardenbergh‘s biographer would be very helpful."

Thanks for asking","In the comps there is a house that sold for a third as much as the others which definitely brought down the value. In the appraisal that house is listed as condition “good,” but it looks like it was red tagged and sold only for cash. So that explains why it’s sold for $260k In a neighborhood where even one bedroom homes are selling for twice to a third as much.

https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/894-Brookside-Dr-Felton-CA-95018/16149426_zpid/?utm_campaign=iosappmessage&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=txtshare

I don’t know if there is a process to draw the appraisers attention to that – no doubt everyone is always trying to make their appraisal value higher — but I would submit, that the comp he chose is not at all comparable and is an outlier as evidenced by the price per square foot being half and a third as much as the other comps.

I suspect that the appraiser had to look very hard for any one bedroom homes and settled for this one sold over a year ago."
