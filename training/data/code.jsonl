First I just wanna say, your coding is style is on point. Your indents are aligned and you actually commented your code (gasp). Good job. And you very nearly got the flexbox nailed.\n\nI haven't run the code, but I can see a possible issue. Since you have `min-width: 50%;` for the flexbox items, the total is 100%. But then you also add another 10px to every margin. So you have 100% plus, uh what? 40px in total margin width for two items? So the flexbox does it's thing, and pushes the second one to the next row.\n\nRather than forcing the width, it's probably better to let flexbox handle the detaails. When we set both width and margins we start gumming up the works.\n\nCheck this out: Here, use `flex: 1;` so the items fill up the width of the container. Then in case the width of the screen is narrow (e.g., a mobile device), we set a min-width so the boxes will stack. Voila! Responsive!

I fixed the indentation so the code was readable.\n2. I added lots of comments so we know what's going on\n3. I added var before variable declarations (always a good idea)\n4. Added the missing 'str' parameter to the scrambleString function\n5. There were some missing pararenthis, which I balanced.\n\nThese changes correct syntax errors, add missing 'var' declarations, and improve code readability and clarity."}]}
