I didn't have much confidence that I would be able to avoid missing 3 classes over a ten-week period, and didn't want to risk being dropped in the first way and becoming a part-time student, so as soon as I was able to withdraw from CMPM 179 (thus keeping full-time student status in exchange for a W grade) I did so. I'm on track to graduate even with a dropped class this quarter and part-time status would mean losing some financial aid, so it was the safer option to withdraw manually. It was a calculated decision.\n\nI really did enjoy the class while I was there, and I'm sure that would continue since I had a good experience taking ART 101 with you as the instructor, but the attendance policy made it feel too risky. I appreciate you writing to give me another chance, as well as a past email encouraging me to keep going. It really does mean a lot. But this whole problem started because I didn't trust that I could maintain perfect attendance throughout the quarter, and even with a second chance, I don't think that changes.

My roommate is sick with something else sniffly and coughy somehow so maybe I also caught that, which would be a miracle. I finished my labs for another class yesterday and I'm wondering how the heck I'm gonna do the lab for this class since I'm sick and my partner dropped the class but I'm sure I'll figure it out. I am relatively certain I can do it by myself just it's partner mandatory... I guess if I can find out how many points are taken off for doing it without a partner I'll just swing it. COVID is fine but somehow it's really lonely and also being stuck in a room semi-permanently with my roommate is also hard, so it's like lonely and too many people at the same time. Mostly I'm missing being able to feed myself and such since I'm in a dorm, but as far as the disease goes I guess I'm feeling pretty good, so it's okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Always good to fill in the attendance/daily check-in.\n\nI'm so sorry you are not well.
