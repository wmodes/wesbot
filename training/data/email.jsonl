I didn’t have much confidence that I would be able to avoid missing 3 classes over a ten-week period, and didn’t want to risk being dropped in the first way and becoming a part-time student, so as soon as I was able to withdraw from CMPM 179 (thus keeping full-time student status in exchange for a W grade) I did so. I’m on track to graduate even with a dropped class this quarter and part-time status would mean losing some financial aid, so it was the safer option to withdraw manually. It was a calculated decision.\n\nI really did enjoy the class while I was there, and I’m sure that would continue since I had a good experience taking ART 101 with you as the instructor, but the attendance policy made it feel too risky. I appreciate you writing to give me another chance, as well as a past email encouraging me to keep going. It really does mean a lot. But this whole problem started because I didn’t trust that I could maintain perfect attendance throughout the quarter, and even with a second chance, I don’t think that changes. So I’d rather take a W now than risk a NP later.\n\nBest of luck with the rest of the quarter."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi Person P,\n\nI understand. I got you. It never occurred to me that the policy might completely scare some students away. I will clarify it in the future. It is meant to be motivational not punitive. Thank you for the feedback.

I don't have anxiety working with other people or anything, but in lab 3 I feel I could just complete better by myself since it is basically our personal portfolio.

If in doubt, don't include it.\n- A link to the position to which you are applying\n\nI always like to offer to draft a recommendation letter highlighting things I consider important for the position.
