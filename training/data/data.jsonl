But it existed in a 1982 narrative frame, so it had become a little rundown since Reaganomics had stripped a lot of the funding for public infrastructure. The station was an opportunity for us to explore untold history, to look beyond or beneath the dominant historical narrative. For example, the 1930s didn't just bring us the New Deal, but belied a serious effort to explore socialism as a political alternative in the United States. The 80s weren't just the beginning of the ascendancy of conservatism, but also gave rise to a response in the form of punk rock and fierce activism. The dark times and Collapse of the 2060s were the starting point for the solarpunk movements at the turn of the 22nd century. Black rock station allowed us to leverage northern Nevada's railroad history to tell dozens of other stories."}]}

It exposes the artist's social networking burden and addiction, revealing both the accumulation and content of his social media messages.

One of my favorite projects, maybe because the work-in to joy-out ratio was so low. We showed movies, people found community and saw great subversive films. We showed free films to the community in unexpected, disused, abandoned locations. We picked movies that we thought were \"subversive\" in some way -- they looked at life through an unusual lens, or they had unconventional, underrepresented protagonists, or they questioned the status quo. It's a creative, community-driven effort to bring people together through the magic of movies. I was involved from 2002 to 2011. For whatever reason, it sparked a resurgence in both guerilla drive-in type projects nationwide as well as an interest in rapidly disappearing commercial drive-ins."}]}

Using motion tracking, laser light projection, and a generative soundscape, it encourages interactions between participants, visually and sonically transforming a regularly trafficked space. Co-related Space highlights participants' active engagement and experimentation with sound and light, including complex direct and indirect behavior and relationships. The key to Co-related Space is a sophisticated visual tracking system combined with complex data aggregation. The system observes people's movements over time, including moving fast or slow, dancing, standing close, hugging, and synchronizing their movements. Visually and sonically, these observed and inferred behaviors are highlighted with sound and light. Visually, the piece sketches laser lines around and between participants with the thickness, quality, and dynamics of the lines determined by the nature of their participation and the relationships between them. In Co-related Space, sound, light, and your fellow participants are everything. Sonically, the piece draws inspiration from ambient sound, developing the complexity and dynamism of each participant's sonic \"voice\" as they interact within the space. The piece was shown at several venues in the Bay Area from 2014 to 2016."}]}

First I just wanna say, your coding is style is on point. Your indents are aligned and you actually commented your code (gasp). Good job. And you very nearly got the flexbox nailed.\n\nI haven't run the code, but I can see a possible issue. Since you have `min-width: 50%;` for the flexbox items, the total is 100%. But then you also add another 10px to every margin. So you have 100% plus, uh what? 40px in total margin width for two items? So the flexbox does it's thing, and pushes the second one to the next row.\n\nRather than forcing the width, it's probably better to let flexbox handle the detaails. When we set both width and margins we start gumming up the works.\n\nCheck this out: Here, use `flex: 1;` so the items fill up the width of the container. Then in case the width of the screen is narrow (e.g., a mobile device), we set a min-width so the boxes will stack. Voila! Responsive!
