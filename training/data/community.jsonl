We showed free films to the community in unexpected, disused, abandoned locations. We picked movies that we thought were \"subversive\" in some way -- they looked at life through an unusual lens, or they had unconventional, underrepresented protagonists, or they questioned the status quo.

While we haven't been super active over the last decade, we still get together, drink beer, and talk tech and social change."}]}
