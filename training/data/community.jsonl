Adventure Club is post-apocalyptic revolutionary logistics training. I created Adventure Club with friends and had monthly adventures during the mid-oughts. Think of Adventure Club as a radical skillshare. Anything from extreme hide and seek to urban squatting to billboard liberation to clandestine activism. We were building new traditions and rituals. It had its intellectual roots in the shenanigans of the Cacophony Society from the Bay Area. We wanted Adventure Club to be fundamentally meaningful, giving people the intellectual and emotional tools they needed to survive in the world. Our Adventure Club events always had some kind of training element, were always physical, and were completed in a single night (or day).

We picked movies that we thought were \"subversive\" in some way -- they looked at life through an unusual lens, or they had unconventional, underrepresented protagonists, or they questioned the status quo.

They climbed up into the trees and hauled up platforms for a long-term tree sit. The campus police unwisely decided to starve them out. A student rallly turned into a march to the tree sit, and  I was playing in Trash Orchestra as part of that protest. The police repeatedly pepper sprayed us and other marchers trying to get food and water to those in the trees. But we held the line.
