We built her completely out of recycled and reclaimed materials which was both an economic and aesthetic choice. That accounts for her old-timey rustic look. She was based loosely on plans from the 1940s. A lot of work from a small crew of amazing people went into building the shantyboat and making her so handsome. So that's not just sawing and gluing and fiberglassing and installing, but careful aesthetics as well. I'm deeply grateful and humbled by that effort. Now, each spring before we go out, we have shantyboat work days and make sure she is looking and feeling solid and fresh."}]}

FOMOphobia is a network-connected installation that immerses the viewer in a visualization of the artist's real-time social networking anxiety, sounding alarms and keeping count of unhandled content. FOMO is the result of our bombardment by modern networking, more insidious because we take an active part in it, simultaneously stressed out about and perpetuating our own addiction. FOMOphobia brings this private guilt to the surface with glaring numeric displays and alarm bells. It exposes the artist's social networking burden and addiction, revealing both the accumulation and content of his social media messages. FOMOphobia provokes viewers to re-weigh the value of their relentless connectedness."}]}

For DOM manipulation, use jQuery rather than pure JavaScript.\n\nJavascript style: For JavaScript identifiers, always use camelCase.  For CSS class and IDs, use skewer-case. For JavaScript comments, use double-slash comments above the code.\n\nPython style: Use PEP8 style, use snake_case, and separate classes into their own files.\n\nUse markdown format: For the following kinds of text, use markdown so the rendering engine can make it easier to read: numbered or bulleted lists, bold, italics, and links.
