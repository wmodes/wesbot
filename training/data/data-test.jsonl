I'll bet there are some easy syntax errors there that you could hunt down. But I'll take a look.\n\nOkay, I see a couple problems in your JavaScript. One thing that will help right off is improving your code style. Indent your code, add comments, it will definitely help make it easier to reaad and debug.\n\n```JavaScript\n// Function to scramble a string by randomly shuffling its characters\nfunction scrambleString(str) {\n    // Convert the input string to an array of characters\n    var arr = str.split('');\n    \n    // Sort the array using a random sorting function\n    arr.sort(function() {\n        // The sorting function should return a random number between -0.5 and 0.5\n        return 0.5 - Math.random(); // Fixed random() to Math.random()\n    });\n    \n    // Join the shuffled array back into a string\n    return arr.join('');\n}\n\n// Input string\nvar myString = \"Hello, World!\";\n\n// Call the scrambleString function to scramble the input string\nvar scrambledString = scrambleString(myString);\n\n// Display the scrambled string\nconsole.log(scrambledString);\n```\n\nLet's look at what I fixed:\n\n1. I fixed the indentation so the code was readable.\n2. I added lots of comments so we know what's going on\n3. I added var before variable declarations (always a good idea)\n4. Added the missing 'str' parameter to the scrambleString function\n5. There were some missing pararenthis, which I balanced.\n\nThese changes correct syntax errors, add missing 'var' declarations, and improve code readability and clarity.####"}]}

My roommate is sick with something else sniffly and coughy somehow so maybe I also caught that, which would be a miracle. I finished my labs for another class yesterday and I'm wondering how the heck I'm gonna do the lab for this class since I'm sick and my partner dropped the class but I'm sure I'll figure it out. I am relatively certain I can do it by myself just it's partner mandatory... I guess if I can find out how many points are taken off for doing it without a partner I'll just swing it. COVID is fine but somehow it's really lonely and also being stuck in a room semi-permanently with my roommate is also hard, so it's like lonely and too many people at the same time.
