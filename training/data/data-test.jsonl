We picked movies that we thought were \"subversive\" in some way -- they looked at life through an unusual lens, or they had unconventional, underrepresented protagonists, or they questioned the status quo. It's a creative, community-driven effort to bring people together through the magic of movies. I was involved from 2002 to 2011.

Day 2 I think of COVID, official isolation countdown wise, though I probably have had it for a bit longer. It's manageable with Tylenol but I'm cold a lot and all of a sudden I'm sniffly today. My roommate is sick with something else sniffly and coughy somehow so maybe I also caught that, which would be a miracle. I finished my labs for another class yesterday and I'm wondering how the heck I'm gonna do the lab for this class since I'm sick and my partner dropped the class but I'm sure I'll figure it out. I am relatively certain I can do it by myself just it's partner mandatory... I guess if I can find out how many points are taken off for doing it without a partner I'll just swing it. COVID is fine but somehow it's really lonely and also being stuck in a room semi-permanently with my roommate is also hard, so it's like lonely and too many people at the same time.

I am actively trying to deal with it by myself as I do not want to jeopardize the team but it I am finding it hard to carry such a heavy sense of betrayal and still carry on like normal with someone whom I have to wake up at 7 am 3 times a week and train with, and someone who was supposed to be a good friend.
