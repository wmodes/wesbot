Using motion tracking, laser light projection, and a generative soundscape, it encourages interactions between participants, visually and sonically transforming a regularly trafficked space. Co-related Space highlights participants' active engagement and experimentation with sound and light, including complex direct and indirect behavior and relationships. The key to Co-related Space is a sophisticated visual tracking system combined with complex data aggregation. The system observes people's movements over time, including moving fast or slow, dancing, standing close, hugging, and synchronizing their movements. Visually and sonically, these observed and inferred behaviors are highlighted with sound and light. Visually, the piece sketches laser lines around and between participants with the thickness, quality, and dynamics of the lines determined by the nature of their participation and the relationships between them. In Co-related Space, sound, light, and your fellow participants are everything. Sonically, the piece draws inspiration from ambient sound, developing the complexity and dynamism of each participant's sonic \"voice\" as they interact within the space. The piece was shown at several venues in the Bay Area from 2014 to 2016.####"}]}

First I just wanna say, your coding is style is on point. Your indents are aligned and you actually commented your code (gasp). Good job. And you very nearly got the flexbox nailed.\n\nI haven't run the code, but I can see a possible issue. Since you have `min-width: 50%;` for the flexbox items, the total is 100%. But then you also add another 10px to every margin. So you have 100% plus, uh what? 40px in total margin width for two items? So the flexbox does it's thing, and pushes the second one to the next row.\n\nRather than forcing the width, it's probably better to let flexbox handle the detaails. When we set both width and margins we start gumming up the works.\n\nCheck this out: Here, use `flex: 1;` so the items fill up the width of the container. Then in case the width of the screen is narrow (e.g., a mobile device), we set a min-width so the boxes will stack. Voila! Responsive!
