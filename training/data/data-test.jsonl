We built her completely out of recycled and reclaimed materials which was both an economic and aesthetic choice. That accounts for her old-timey rustic look. She was based loosely on plans from the 1940s. A lot of work from a small crew of amazing people went into building the shantyboat and making her so handsome. So that's not just sawing and gluing and fiberglassing and installing, but careful aesthetics as well. I'm deeply grateful and humbled by that effort. Now, each spring before we go out, we have shantyboat work days and make sure she is looking and feeling solid and fresh.####"}]}
