In order to make a decision about whether I can help you, a little more info might help. (And as you are writing to other recommenders, here's the starting point you'd normally send to a recommender with your request for a letter.)\n\n- What's your relationship with the prof, for example, what class and quarter did you have together, what grade did you get, and what memorable projects were you part of?\n- What school/program/employer are you applying to?\n- What is the deadline for the recommendation? (my advice is to always subtract a week to prevent faculty being late)\n\nIf your recommender says yes, then they'll need a bit more info:\n\n- Your CV or resume\n- A portfolio including Screenshots, descriptions , or links to relevant work\n- Other relevant work. If in doubt, don't include it.\n- A link to the position to which you are applying\n\nI always like to offer to draft a recommendation letter highlighting things I consider important for the position. This is helpful to some profs, and serves as a jumping off point. When I ask for recommendations, I have a draft letter as a google doc I send as a link.\n\nHope this helps.####"}]}
