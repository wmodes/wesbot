I had no idea that comics could be an intelligent, thoughtful, emotional medium for adults, and I was floored. While I made occasional work for projects for a while, I hadn't tried my hand at my own comic. After my first punk rafting journey in 2005, I created a comic that captured the feel of our adventure. I am most proud of a comic adaptation of a Howard Zinn story, chronicling Howard Zinn's introduction to radicalism."}]}

Costco is Black Rock City's premier purveyor of soulmates since 1998. People I've camped with know me as Rico Thunder.
