There would be 2 states - Closed state and Opened state. While closed, you can hire and fire employees, buy and add furniture/equipment to your restaurant/kitchen, and create/assign job tasks to employees for them to follow. While opened, customers will enter and sit at the tables and chairs that you placed, and make orders for food, then the employees will get their order, make the food, give it to them, and you will earn money.\n\nAt minimum, the game would have maybe one type of equipment (a stove) and two types of furniture (chair, table). Everything will be placed on a grid, so NPCs can path-find through it using A Star.
