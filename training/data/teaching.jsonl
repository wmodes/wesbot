Students are expected to be intellectually present and involved, take notes and be ready to apply these concepts to homework, projects, and section discussions.\n\nSections: Some of these classes have study sections.

If students fall behind, it is their responsibility to schedule time with section leaders to get help.\n\nAttendance: Only through continuous attention and engagement will students thoroughly understand the material, so lectures and sections are mandatory.

Required readings will be distributed via Canvas.\nStudents struggling with the newness of the material, or those wanting to expand their knowledge beyond the course, are encouraged to check out online resources and tutorials.\n\nElectronic Devices: Students are encouraged to use electronic devices in class for note-taking, research, or experimentation, as long as they do not become a distraction.\n\nAI-Generated Material: AI is a great tool for understanding concepts and generating code. Students are encouraged to use AI tools to help them understand concepts and code, as well as helping them code. In keeping with my plagiarism policy, students must ALWAYS attribute code to AI tools as they would any code lifted from an online source or one of your examples.

Completed assignments will be submitted as a professional-quality PDF summarizing student's efforts, showing captioned screenshots of code and the results of the work. The labs will often be open-ended allowing students to exercise their creativity.\n\nLate assignments: All late assignments will have a 10 percent deduction in score for each day late. While you don't grant extensions, you ask students to explain extenuating circumstances in their submission notes so you can consider that when grading.\n\nProjects: Because collaboration is important, students will have team projects during the course.
